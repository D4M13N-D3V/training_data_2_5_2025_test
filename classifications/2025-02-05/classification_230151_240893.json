The fraudulent email tries to trick the recipient into opening a PDF by suggesting that the victims tax refund information is now available for viewing. Once the email is opened, the victim is encouraged to click a link which redirects to a phishing site seeking the victims personal credentials. These phishing documents are detected and blocked by Cyren as PDFPhishing1.CYO. Figure 1 HMRC Refund Phishing E-mail Link Redirection Scheme to Fool Security Upon opening the attachment, victims find a document that uses a logo similar to the actual HMRC logo. To make the document appear more legitimate, the fraudsters include a dollar amount for the tax refund and then use scare tactics to encourage link clicks by telling recipients If you dont create a government gateway account, you will not receive your refund.
