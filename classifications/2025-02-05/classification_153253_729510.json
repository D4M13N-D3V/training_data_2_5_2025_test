Management Commentary Jason Remillard, Data443s founder and Chief Executive Officer, commented, Fiscal 2020 represented a year of strategic progress and record performance against an unprecedented backdrop, and Im extremely proud of our results for 2020. We realized significant growth in revenue and deferred revenues. Importantly, our deferred revenues continue to grow, which is a strong indicator of our future revenue trends. Im happy to report that our capital structure is in the best position its ever been, as we spent a significant portion of 2020 addressing our outstanding convertible debt, which dovetailed into the Companys first equity financing transaction in December. We successfully reduced our derivative liabilities by over 10 million while growing our business with an impressive slate of acquisitions throughout 2020. When other companies in our industry were forced to reduce and contract their operations or overpay for acquisitions with questionable financial metrics, we expanded our business in a financially prudent manner. We managed to acquire three distinct companies, open an office in Dubai, continue organic growth, and close net new business. These actions only further validate our business plan and the foundation we established and have continued to build upon since 2018. We wouldnt have been able to achieve many of these key milestones without our incredible and growing Data443 team. Throughout the pandemic, we didnt miss a beat in delivering mission-critical services to our customers. These customers represent a wide range of industries, including those considered as essential services, along with education and banking. Because of these efforts, Im proud to report that our 2020 customer retention rate exceeded 98. This reinforces the essential role Data443 plays in our customers operations, which bodes very well for our future growth. Looking forward to the rest of 2021, we expect to see continued strong demand in data security, which reflects the continued risk environment from hacking and ransomware infections. Also, we anticipate a growing regulatory environment that will further compel businesses to deploy security measures for customer data. While not entirely immune to economic factors, the data security and privacy market should remain strong as more businesses accept that they must allocate resources for data security. Were continuing to invest in our staff and technology to meet this growing demand. As we announced in February, we have filed our Schedule 14C with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as we take the necessary steps to rationalize our capital structure in preparation for our application to up-list our stock to a superior market. Were excited to take these steps and believe these actions are in the best interest of our shareholders. Included in our recently filed Form 10-K you will note subsequent events following the reporting period of December 31, 2020. Please do take the time to review these as they are important to our next steps for the Company. The 10-K can be found at the following link  Remillard concluded by stating, As you can imagine, I remain highly confident in our business case with our continually expanded solutions offering that is anchored in solid security capabilities that deliver uniquely advanced privacy functions for organizations of all sizes that are unmatched in todays marketplace. Our suite of products and services secures our competitive positioning, differentiating us from the competition, and keeps us in a leadership position as we move into 2021. Our recent successes of several high-ticket contracts, along with our recent acquisition of ArcMail  , sets the stage for the remainder of 2021. Analysts, customers, competitors, and partners are taking note. Together with a growing portfolio of diverse customers, greater access to financial resources, and a growing sales pipeline with an outstanding team of professionals, we are poised for even greater heights in 2021.
