Internal communication and client exchanges are saved somewhere in the mass of personal content and overlooked messages. Businesses need to be prepared with a strategy for archiving and locating information within e-mail platforms, quickly and efficiently, to enable data compliance and business continuity. Challenge Companys cost for data storage is too high, A study by the Compliance, Governance and Oversight Council offered that nearly 69 of the data stored has no value to the company. By that math, the amount companies are spending on data storage could be exponentially higher than needed. Unfortunately, without a process to identify and classify data, data duplicates are often stored in multiple locations, without structure, increasing storage cost and discovery difficulty. ArcMail reduces storage costs by using custom retention policies based on content, ensuring accurate and compliant copies of all data and communications are retained for the entire period required for each unique piece of data, while non-valuable data and data duplicates do not occupy storage space. Challenge Organization needs a way to simplify eDiscovery and Compliance With 60 of essential data, often including sensitive content, being exchanged and stored through e-mail, when organizations need to locate specific content for legal purposes or to demonstrate regulatory compliance, they need a way to quickly and easily locate and find the data they search for.
