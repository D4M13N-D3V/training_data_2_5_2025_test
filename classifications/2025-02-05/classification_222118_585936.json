Our sales and recurring revenue continue to be enabled by the aggressive marketing investments that we have made throughout this year, including the investment into relationships with several analyst firms. We have seen an increase in our multi-year pre-paid subscription sales, higher recurring revenue streams, and increases in the average selling price of our products, along with the pointed success of up-selling opportunities. Our technology stack is unique in the industry, enabling us to win deals in a variety of industries and settings. Moreover, we continue to receive inbound opportunities that require a broader product portfolio set  and increasingly require endpoint security capabilities. Our focus on privacy-enabled data security resounds well with these requirements. Data identification is much more valuable when you can protect, move, and remove access to it when it is time, even better when you make any data that happens to be stolen  useless in the hands of thieves-recovering from a ransomware attack  your data, devices and worker productivity  in minutes? These are all capabilities that Data443 provides today and are predominately unique in delivering. Our business continues to thrive despite an increasingly challenging economy and the lingering effects of the pandemic. We continue our balanced approach of new product capabilities and integration with partners while delivering our resoundingly 5-star rated support with teams who actually do answer the phone and go over and above to ensure our clients receive value from their purchases and spread the word internally and externally for us. Because of these efforts, I am proud to report that our customer retention rate thus far in 2021 has exceeded 99. These results are due to the complete professionals we have at Data443.
