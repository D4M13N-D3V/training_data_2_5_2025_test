GDPR is a regulation which applies to anyone doing business in or with Europe. If you process the personal information of EU subjects you need to comply. The introduction of GDPR has forced organisations of all sizes to re-think their data governance processes, which is generating a renewed interest in email archiving. Three months on from enforcement date  what has happened? In the lead-up to GDPR enforcement in May 2018, new businesses and categories of technology to help organisations comply with the regulation appeared. Vendors quickly re-positioned their products and services to demonstrate how they could help. The upshot of this flurry of activity was heightened awareness of GDPR amongst many people, whether they had a vested business interest or not. Fast forward to present day and many of these highly aware individuals have become a headache for businesses  they know their rights and are exercising them. According to the Financial Times, Facebook has seen a three or fourfold increase in the number of subject access requests SAR and Marriott, the hotel operator, has asked for an extension of the SAR response window, to enable it to cope with the volumes. The same article highlights the trend for tools and even apps that allow individuals to easily submit SARs. What appears to be top of mind for many organisations is how they can respond in a timely manner to the requests they are receiving from these newly aware individuals. Here is what you need to know and how Cyren can help.
