Clarifying here that Bad Rabbit is a variant of the widely reported NotPetya ransomware , which we covered in a blog earlier this year. Bad Rabbit leverages one of the U.S. National Security Agency-developed exploits stolen and released by the Shadow Brokers group last April. Among those exploits was EternalBlue, used by WannaCry last May. Bad Rabbit utilizes EternalRomance , which, like EternalBlue, targets a different vulnerability in SMBv1, the Microsoft Server Message Block SMB file sharing protocol. Although Bad Rabbit shares some similarities to NotPetya for example, a virtually identical ransom note and propagation via the SMB vulnerability, much of the NotPetya code has been rewritten. This time around, Bad Rabbit employs a Trojan-like tool to mine credentials from infected systems, something that NotPetya did not do. Figure 1 Ransom page from the Bad Rabbit ransomware.
