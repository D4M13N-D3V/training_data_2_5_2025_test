This week lets discuss the concept of context. Here at Resilient we believe that fundamentally the more information an organization has about an access request the more likely it is to make the correct access decision. Context is a term that describes the sum of all information we can gather about an access request. Its closely related to the concept of Attribute-based Access Control ABAC that we discussed in last weeks blog see IAM Concept of the Week RBAC vs. ABAC . There we defined attributes as pieces of information that act as building blocks to describe relationships between users, actions and resources. With enough information or attributes we can understand the context of any access request. Attributes are broken down into four categories Subject Role, department, company, certifications, biometrics etc. Action Read, write, edit, download etc. Resource Apps, docs, files, APIs, services etc. Environment Time, location, device type, threat level etc. Organizations need to discover and gather these attributes in order to evaluate them against their access policies. The challenge however is that much of this information no longer resides solely within internal databases, such as Active Directory, but instead is dispersed across external databases. In a future post well discuss the importance of a network-based approach to understanding context. Next week well talk more about the interplay between attributes and policy engines.
