These forum pages then tried to obtain login credentials or redirect a user to pages designed to download Potentially Unwanted Program Adware on their device. Figure 3  Fake giveaway luring users to a phishing page These threads on Reddit and a Square Enix forum suggest this phishing campaign was also spread using the in-game chat feature, whisper. Attackers frequently use communication channels other than email to avoiddelay detection. Targeted phishing attacks often follow press releases and major events like Amazon Prime Day and national holidays. The best thing users can do is slow down and closely review emails and links before clicking calls to action, entering information, or opening attachments.
