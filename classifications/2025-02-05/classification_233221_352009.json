Last week we talked about the importance of context and how it describes the sum of all information or attributes that we can gather about an access request. This week well cover how attributes are related to access policies, and also the attributed-based XACML Extensible Access Control Markup Language model. As we mentioned previously, attributes offer a multi-dimensional way to express, in detail, the relationship between the subject, the action, the resource and the environment. By themselves however, attributes are not enough. We need rules to resolve these attributes against. This is where access policies come in and with them we have the ability to create policies as simplistic or as fine-grained as we want. For example, a simple policy could be only hospital administrators can access all patient records. A more complex policy might be that only an administrator, with a speciality in oncology, physically located in a certain hospital department, on a certain device can update a specific patient record. The XACML model offers a mechanism to write and implement these policies. It was originally developed by OASIS back in 2003. A key advantage of the XACML approach is that it separates the access decision from the point of use. This means that policies are managed externally and can be updated independent of the application that is being secured. The model architecture is comprised of the following components Policy Enforcement Point PEP  Intercepts the business flow to verify that the user is authorized. Sends the authorization request to the PDP which then grants or denies the request. Policy Decision Point PDP  Processes the authorization request and evaluates it against the organizations access policies. It produces a decision that it sends back to the PEP. Queries the Policy Information Point PIP to retrieve information or attributes. Policy Admin Point PAP  Creates and manages the access policies. The policies are then deployed to the PDP. Policy Information Points PIP  Connects the PDP to sources of attributes. Finally, lets end with a simple example that shows the XACML model in action A user attempts to access a protected resource The Policy Enforcement Point PEP intercepts the request sending it to the Policy Decision Point PDP to verify that the user is authorized The Policy Decision Point PDP evaluates the access policies related to this request The Policy Decision Point PDP retrieves attributes related to the request from the Policy Information Points PIP Based on the policy and the underlying attributes the user is granted access to the protected resource Further Reading XACML Wikipedia Other blogs in the IAM Concept of the Week series SAML, OAuth2 and OpenID Connect FIDO Fast Identity Online Authentication vs Authorization RBAC versus ABAC Context Try it for Free Instant Data Classification Cyren URL Category Chacker Prev IAM Concept of the Week Context CLASSIDOCS.COM ANNOUNCES AI FOR DATA CLASSIFICATION Next Company Partners Resources Investor Relations Products Freeware Demo Solutions Contact Us Privacy Management Service by Data443",
