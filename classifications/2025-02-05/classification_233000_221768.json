These links usually lead to a fake website and entice you to enter sensitive information. Other links can also contain malware, which could give cybercriminals access to all your stored data. Earlier this month, we witnessed a phishing link attack on CIMB Clicks bank customers in Malaysia which combined some common social engineering techniques scare tactics with some newer technical misdirection techniques  TinyURL . We decided to provide a detailed blow-by-blow on how this particular TinyURL scam worked. The CIMB Clicks site, which is the online banking portal for CIMB bank, offers customers online banking, insurance, and share trading services. Customers can also pay bills, inquire about account balances, and conduct other financial transactions. Common Phishing Link Scam Tactics The CIMB Clicks phishing scam employs two increasingly common techniques to entice the victim into participation. First, the language in the attached documents attempts to scare the customer into thinking that access to their CIMB accounts has been restricted. Second, the scam obfuscates the fake phishing link by converting it into a shortened URL using a URL-shortening web service, like TinyURL . Cyren detects these phishing documents as XMLPhish.H  for the fake MSWORD CIMB Document and PDFPhish.EVZ  for fake PDF CIMB Document. Cyren AnalysisCIMB Clicks Phishing Link Scam The following images show what the fraudulent MSWord and PDF documents look like when opened by the recipient. Figure 1 Fake MSWORD CIMB Document Figure 2 Fake PDF CIMB Document HTTP Redirection Using URL Shortening Web Service Clicking the highlighted URL link leads to the following HTTP redirection Figure 3 below. You will notice that the URL link appears as a shortened URL via bit.ly. Increasingly, we are noticing that criminals are obfuscating their malicious links using URL-shortening web services, such as bitly.com and tinyurl.com. By using the shortened URL, the criminal is able to prevent the victim from hovering over the link to see that the URL destination is not actually the one intended. Figure 3 HTTPLog Redirection A Neverending Loop Following is the process once the victim arrives on the Fake CIMB Clicks site Figure 3. Notably, during the last phase, there is an infinite loop while capturing the email address. Figure 4 Infinite loop in the fake CIMB Clicks credentials capturing process The phishing domains lead to these IP addresses 198.50.156.168 which belongs to OVH Hosting and 198.38.82.230 which belongs to Mochahost.com as seen in the images below. Figure 5 WHOIS IP of Phishing Domains Key Takeaways on How to Identify  Spot Phishing Links 1. Check the URL Make sure the URL starts with https. The letter S at the end of HTTP means the website has an SSL certificate installed. You still have to be cautious because SSL certificates are not hard to obtain. Phishing links will also resemble the legitimate website as closely as possible. Additionally, hovering over the link allows you to preview it without clicking. 2. Check the Content Most legitimate websites will look like theyve been lived in. Contact information should be present and grammar should be spot on. If its hard to find contact information and the content is written poorly, this is a red flag. 3. Who Owns the Website? Doing a simple WHOIS lookup can help you find information about the website owner. Things to look for are creation date, IP address, and IP location. Many phishing attacks using brand new domains. 4. What Payment Methods Are They Using? Never enter payment information on a website you havent vetted. Most websites will use popular payment services like PayPal. If a website only asks for a bank transfer, run for the hills. 5. Read Reviews Simply type your search query plus the word scam or review into Google. People dont like getting burned by phishing links and others will likely post their experiences online. 6. Check the Senders Email Address A common tactic cybercriminals use is slightly altering the domain of a reputable company so they can convince you they are legitimate. They might use a combination of a popular company name alongside a public domain to lure you in. Youll want to check twice for any errors or inconsistencies. 7. Are you Being Asked for Personal Information? Be wary of emails or pages that ask for sensitive information such as social security number, bank details, or tax return information. Even personal questions such as your first pets name, favorite color, or the middle school you attended. Those questions are commonly asked when another form of authentication is required during a login attempt. 8. Sense of Urgency Does the message urge you to take immediate action before its too late? This is a common play on your emotions and cybercriminals know its effectiveness. This is why we recommend enabling a 2FA two-factor authentication on all your accounts. This adds a second layer to an authentication process. A personal code will be sent to your cellphone and it has to be used in order to log in. 9. Are There a Lot of Pop-Ups? In this day and age, very aggressive pop-up windows are not as common. A good practice is to never enter sensitive information on these pages. There should always be a secure page and a pop-up window screams non-professional.
