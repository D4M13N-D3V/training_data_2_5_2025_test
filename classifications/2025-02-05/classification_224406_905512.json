As part of our announcement    Our partner offering has been in development for a specific governmental organization in Canada for some time now and recently went live with the legalization on October 17. The offering has several components  however at the highest level  it is about enabling the host organization localfederal government, municipality, medical facility, dispensary, etc. to ensure that record transaction and identity privacy is compliant with other local and federal laws in Canada for example, PIPEDA  in the EU, GDPR and others, and soon in California  CCPA and probably federally soon afterwards. However, what drives this solution isnt the product being sold  its the core and overreaching requirement that is sweeping the landscape for people to control and manage their own privacy and feel confident that it is being managed and retained. In reality, it has little specifically to do with Cannabis use, however , p erhaps Cannabis use is FINALLY the catalyst that will drive people to care more about their privacy. Regardless of whether you support the legalization, or other such changes to our society  in general the information becoming available has not just some risk to a person like having your SSN stolen, its bad, but unless its leveraged in other contexts, chances are you wont have a direct impact. However, if you ordered a legal product online, there may be other parties you dont feel the need to share it with perhaps another government, your employer, etc.. This isnt about hiding things  its about being in control. The HIPAA act helps a bit here, however it is mainly about controlling the disclosure at the consolidation level the clinic, the pharmacy, etc.. It does little to enable the end user patient to control, share, manage their own information. The solution, that is already in production and public use by the way, supports these core tenants of what Data443 is about  Identification, Governance, Protection, Distribution. At a high level depending on your context  ClassiDocs to identify, classify and govern  ARALOC to protect and distribute. Some security architecture and design to navigate repositories and data joining, some partner software to provide some connectors and access control. This is the Personal Privacy offering, in production, being used by thousands  which we feel is the blueprint for future privacy requirement in many industries  US Healthcare just one of them. Additionally, as the blockchain ecosystem settles a bit  big players are entering more and more  we expect a few de facto blockchains to come to the forefront for the market place. Our existing privacy compliance work efforts in this space  Ripple , IOTA, etc. have given us a leap frog advantage as we have the regulatory compliance, personal privacy, encryption  ARALOC  and other technologies to not just govern enterprise data sets, but also enable personal privacy  more to come on this soon!
