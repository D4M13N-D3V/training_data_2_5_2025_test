Develop clear guidance through policies and procedures to align your shared drive with your business processes and records management policies. Classify your files by function. Consistent categorization increases probability of finding files when you need them. Lastly, but very importantly, eliminate redundant, outdated, and trivial ROT files from your folders. Be rigorous in this effortdo not take ROT files into your new ECM environment. 2 Select Expert Teams In the wise words of leadership guru Simon Sinek , A team is not a group of people that work together. A team is a group of people that trust each other. You need that team. Assemble subject matter experts SMEs who trust each other and have experience in content cleanup and migration. Your experts will help you determine historical and corporate knowledge to validate the importance of files and documents. SMEs know what information should remain, what should be deleted, and why its important. They can also communicate among all users to ensure project and portfolio goals and deadlines remain on-track. 3 Plan Well, Execute Well Your information governance IG solution is in place, your goals and timelines set, and your team assembled its time to migrate your data. Good migrations begin with great plans and end with disciplined communications and execution. Take time to remind all users of established timelines and keep them informed of any changes.
