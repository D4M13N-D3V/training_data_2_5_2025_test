Data443 or the Company OTC ATDS, a data security and privacy software company for All Things Data Security, today provided an update regarding its proposed uplist to The Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq. Upon the filing of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 the 2022 Form 10-K, the Company will no longer be subject to Nasdaqs higher seasoning threshold for price compliance, which the Company hopes will hasten its uplisting to Nasdaq. Until the filing of the 2022 Form 10-K, the Company has been and will continue to be subject to Nasdaqs heightened seasoning rules that apply to all companies that have completed reverse mergers and do not yet have four full years of audited financial statements on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5110c includes a 30-of-60-day price requirement, which until the filing of the 2022 Form 10-K requires the Company to evidence a closing bid price of at least 4.00 per share for 30 of 60 days both prior to the filing of the Companys initial listing application with Nasdaq and prior to the actual listing of the Companys securities on Nasdaq. We are excited to file our 2022 Form 10-K and, as a seasoned issuer, no longer be subject to Nasdaqs 30-of-60-day price requirement. We remain hopeful that completion of our planned public offering and price compliance at that time will enable the Company to complete our uplist to Nasdaq. I am also hopeful that doing so will further position the Company as a prominent cybersecurity and data management company. Delivering on our business plan continues to be our top priority. As stated previously, our efforts to uplist to Nasdaq are central to our continued funding, acquisition strategy, and organic growth efforts, said CEO and founder, Jason Remillard.
