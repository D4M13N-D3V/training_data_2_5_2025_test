Jason Remillard, Founder and CEO of Data443 commented, This latest win for our Data Archive Manager formerly known as Arcmail leverages our newest platform based on HPE hardware. What makes this win so important to us is that this customer is not just a regulatory organization it is also managing multiple years of datasets with related privacy, discovery, and legislative requirements to have this data safely stored and instantly available, all with a solid chain of custody in a non-repudiable fashion. While an impossible task for this self-regulatory organization, this is just another days work for Data443.

Virtually every recent customer engagement now has data migration in scope, and the size and scale continue to expand rapidly. Two years ago, our average size was around 10TB now we routinely get requests in the 100 to 3,000-9,000TB range, further highlighting how explosively large these datasets are becoming, concluded Mr. Remillard.
