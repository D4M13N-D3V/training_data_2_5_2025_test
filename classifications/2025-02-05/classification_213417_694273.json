Data443   or the Company OTCPK ATDS, a leading data security and privacy software company, is pleased to announce its sponsorship of the latest CISO Executive Network series titled, Data Governance, Protection  Privacy. As the current pandemic emergency continues to impact face to face meetings, forcing our customers maintain operations under hybrid conditions, all of them continue to rely on our solutions and capabilities, said Jason Remillard, Founder and CEO of Data443  . Our continued outreach and direct communication is an essential element to our commitment to our customers. We have found that in many cases a virtual presentation is more effective, as we can reduce the distractions that other events carry with them. The topic of this series, Data Governance, Protection  Privacy, complements our solutions capability, and we feel it is necessary to share customer success stories and leading edge technology integrations with industry thought leaders as they consider and further develop their privacy and security strategies. With this in mind, we will be discussing the importance of, and urgency for, implementing strong classification guidelines as weve seen across the market. Its a very timely and candid story of why classification projects historically fail, the problems behind it, and how exactly to fix it. The conversation will be supported by our recent win and deployment with a major bank in the Middle East  where we are the first vendor in the world to leverage the Microsoft DKE framework for AIP and of course continue to leverage our strong relationship with leading industry technology partners, concluded Mr. Remillard. The CISO Executive Network is a peer-to-peer collaboration network dedicated to helping information security, IT risk management, privacy, and compliance executives be more successful. Chapter meetings are open to members only. If you are interested in becoming a member, you may view membership criteria and submit to join today. About Data443 Risk Mitigation, Inc.
