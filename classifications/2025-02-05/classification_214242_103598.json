Our years of in-depth experience in this market has taught us that marketers and business owners of all sizes want to be privacy centric and compliant  but also dont want to destroy or lose their material investment in customer relationships. Being cognizant of this, responsible in the privacy relationship and having a different approach towards consent, opt-in, and ongoing stewardship of these facets  all while keeping in compliance with changing laws backs up our research for success. Data443s Global Privacy Manger is built on the ClassiDocs award winning data classification platform and Data443s WordPress GDPR Framework, which is currently powering more than 30,000 businesses worldwide for the EUs GDPR Privacy Law. The combined platform automatically searches the data residing in cloud application, databases, servers, and endpoints used by businesses to discover, classify and map customer data. Its out-of-the-box workflows are easily tailored to fit the size and scope of any business and include automated processes to save time and confirm compliance. At its foundation, Global Privacy Manager focuses on creating the customers privacy experience. Its full privacy portal, customizable consent management and simple reporting create a one-stop location for customers to manage their privacy rights, allowing for a seamless transition between submitting a Subject Access Request SAR, the business classifying and mapping and discovering privacy data, and reporting back to the customer. By their nature, laws and regulations set the minimum acceptable standard. But providing the bare minimum never leads to a quality experience for the customer, said Remillard. We are offering an initial early adopters program that will allow us to onboard clients who are just starting to test the waters with privacy compliance efforts  regardless of which one  and receive a fully branded, customizable, personalized experience within minutes to demonstrate the platform capabilities and value statement.
