The good news that cost is down 10 over previous years. The bad news companies in the study have experienced larger breaches an increase of 1.8 equating to 24,000 records per breach. Per GDPR General Data Protection Regulation mandates, service providers are required to take appropriate and effective measures to safeguard consumers personal data. If a breach occurs, the organization must notify both the Information Commissioners Office ICO AND the customers should the breach be likely to adversely affect consumer privacy. So, how does GDPR define security and breaches? What do organizations need to do, and how are organizations held accountable? Lets review these in detail Security Service providers must take appropriate measures to safeguard the security of your service and inform customers of potential security risks. This includes instituting processes for authorized access, secure data storage and transmission, and implementing security policies commensurate to the levels of data used in providing the service. Data controllers should collaborate with network providers to ensure reasonable cooperation and protection of the data. Your company must also inform customers regarding the security risks incurred in providing their data, specifically regarding 1 the nature of the risk, 2 the measures consumers take to safeguard against the risk and 3 the nominal costs of taking those measures. Breaches Personal data breaches are any security breach leading to the accidental or unlawful access or action affecting consumers personal data. This may affect the accuracy, storage, analysis, or transmission of the data and can open the consumer to significant risk. Should a breach occur, your data protection officer DPO must contact the ICO, determine whether they must notify consumers, and record each breach in a specified breach log. The ICO notification identifies specifics of the breach dates and times of breach and detection information about the type of breach and the personal data affected. DPOs should also include as many details as possible in the log regarding the effects and the efforts taken to mitigate them. If you decide to contact your customers, DPOs must include details including estimated date of breach, incident summary, likely effect upon data and the individual, and measures taken to mitigate these effects. And The Ugly So, what happens if you dont report these breaches? Failure to submit this information may incur a 1,000 approximately 1,400 fine per breach incident. This is on top of other fines related to the severity of the breach and the determination of how the organization managed the situation. And The Good, Again At the end of the day, the GDPR codifies and standardizes an approach to safeguard consumers personal data. Each organization is responsible for the data it requests to serve its customer base. These definitions, procedures, and penalties are in place to protect businesses lower costs, better reputation and individuals data rights and security. Better organizations, better processes, better consumer protection. Its a win-win-win scenario!
