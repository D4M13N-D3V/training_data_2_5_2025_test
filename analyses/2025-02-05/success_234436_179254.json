We previously reported our detection of key changes in Lockys methods on June 27  new sandbox evasion techniques , July 4  new downloading technique , July 14  attachment format change , and most recently July 21  embedded in JavaScript   the criminal syndicate behind Locky is evidently quite busy, and quite resourceful. The email being sent in this latest wave, as often before, uses business finance-related topics to lure users into opening its attachment, which is ZIP-archived JavaScript. Comparing this variant to the earlier variants, it has added another layer of obfuscation which decrypts and executes the real Locky downloader script. A quick de-obfuscation shows a similar structure to the previous Locky downloader scripts. The download behavior is similar to that seen before, as the files downloaded from the URLs inserted in the script are decrypted and dropped in the Windows Temp directory. What we find most interesting in this latest Locky wave is that instead of downloading an EXE binary, this ransomware component now comes as a DLL binary. Cyren detects this variant as W32Locky.AT_1.gen!Eldorado. The DLL is loaded using rundll32.exe with the following command line syntax Upon closer inspection, the DLL is using a custom packer to prevent anti-malware scanners from easily detecting it. Upon successful execution, the loaded DLL does its usual ransomware routine to find and encrypt files in the affected system, before dropping and displaying the ransom payment instruction pages. Files encrypted by this variant are appended with .zepto as their file extension. Clicking on the onion link directs the user to the same Locky Decryptor page we have seen in previous Locky waves.

    "content": "### End-User Guidance on Data Security and Protection Against Locky Ransomware\n\n#### 1. Security Best Practices\n\n- **Email Safety:**\n  - Be cautious with email attachments and links, especially from unfamiliar senders.\n  - Verify sender details and look for red flags like typos or urgent requests.\n  - Avoid opening attachments or clicking links from untrusted sources.\n\n- **Software Updates:**\n  - Regularly update software, operating systems, and applications to patch vulnerabilities.\n  - Enable automatic updates for antivirus and other security software.\n\n- **Backup Data:**\n  - Conduct regular backups of important data using secure methods.\n  - Store backups both on-site (e.g., external drives) and off-site (e.g., cloud storage).\n  - Disconnect backups after use to prevent ransomware access.\n\n- **Antivirus Protection:**\n  - Install and maintain reputable antivirus software.\n  - Consider advanced threat protection solutions for better defense.\n\n#### 2. Data Protection Recommendations\n\n- **Secure Backups:**\n  - Use encryption for backup data, especially for sensitive information.\n  - Test backups periodically to ensure data integrity and accessibility.\n\n- **Encryption:**\n  - Encrypt sensitive files to protect against unauthorized access.\n  - Use strong, unique passwords and consider a password manager.\n\n- **Access Control:**\n  - Implement role-based access to limit data exposure.\n  - Restrict user privileges to the minimum necessary for job functions.\n\n#### 3. Safe Usage Guidelines\n\n- **Download Caution:**\n  - Avoid downloading files from untrusted sources or websites.\n  - Verify file sources and avoid executable files from unknown senders.\n\n- **Macro Warnings:**\n  - Disable macros in documents unless necessary.\n  - Be cautious with JavaScript files and ZIP archives from unknown sources.\n\n#### 4. Common Security Risks and Prevention\n\n- **Phishing Awareness:**\n  - Educate yourself on phishing tactics; recognize suspicious requests.\n  - Use alternative communication methods to verify requests before responding.\n\n- **Network Vigilance:**\n  - Ensure Wi-Fi networks use strong encryption (WPA3).\n  - Use VPNs for public networks to secure data transmission.\n\n#### 5. Privacy Protection Measures\n\n- **Data Handling:**\n  - Limit sharing of sensitive data; only provide to trusted entities.\n  - Regularly review and update privacy settings on devices and accounts.\n\n- **Network Security:**\n  - Use a reputable VPN for public Wi-Fi.\n  - Keep router firmware updated and change default passwords.\n\n#### 6. When to Seek Additional Security Support\n\n- **Infection Response:**\n  - If infected, immediately isolate the system from the network.\n  - Contact IT or security professionals for assistance.\n  - Avoid paying ransoms without exploring recovery options.\n\nBy following these guidelines, users can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to ransomware like Locky and protect their data effectively. Stay informed and proactive in maintaining your digital security.",
