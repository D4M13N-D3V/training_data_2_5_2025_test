How Attackers Take Advantage of Email Delivery Platforms Email magnitude  Email delivery services dont usually limit the total number of mail recipients. This enables an attacker to send large volumes of targeted emails. Tracking and personalization  Attackers can visualize and measure the impact of sent emails on the targets, enabling them to launch customized spear phishing attacks afterwards. Bypassing email filtering capabilities  Attackers distribute phishing URLs that are hosted on legitimate and trustworthy domains that belong to real email delivery platforms. This makes it almost impossible for Microsoft 365 and SEGs to detect and filter the attacks. Related Spear Phishing, Whaling, and Delayed Detonation, Oh My! SendGrid Phishing Attacks on the Rise SendGrid is a relatively popular cloud-based platform. Additionally, businesses use this platform to send more than 70 billion transactional emails per month. These could include Shipping notifications Sign-up confirmations Password resets Email newsletters Nurture tracks Other automated or campaign-based messages SendGrid provides the digital signatures and authentication that companies utilize to validate incoming emails, helping to deliver an average 95 deliverability rate. Unfortunately, if those emails came from compromised SendGrid accounts, they are particularly dangerous because they are not likely to be blocked by email security services. Phishing attackers oftentimes purposely exploit the branding of global companies, such as SendGrid , within their scams. Since those brands have such a good reputation, the attackers can lull victims into a false sense of security. With such a large number of these trusting users, they are an easy, attractive target for phishing scams . Unfortunately, on August 28 of 2020, KrebsonSecurity.com reported an unusually large amount of SendGrid customer accounts having been hijacked and used to distribute massive amounts of phishing and malware attacks .
