About 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is created every day. Yet a recent Global Databerg Report suggested that 52 percent of all data stored by organisations globally is dark data, meaning its content and value is unknown. Additionally, 33 percent of data is considered redundant, which poses a serious threat given the EUs new laws regarding GDPR .
