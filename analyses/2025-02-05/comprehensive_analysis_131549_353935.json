It mostly works on an Apache Spark framework, an open-source cluster computing framework that provides programmers with an interface to develop applications in Python or Scala. It also offers some cutting-edge machine learning applications on top of it. It is based in San Francisco and was founded by the team behind the Apache Spark project. Why Databricks? It comes with BI, SQL and Scala drag and drop visual programming that enables easy data discovery. Its graphical workflow view makes the whole development process much easier to understand. Its strict quality control due to Databricks strong focus on code reusability and collaboration via the Databricks Notebook sharing system. It is scalable and can handle both structured and semi-structured data types. Databricks can be used with various languages like R or Python, allowing for large-scale data analysis. Its datasets can be a part of a single or distributed system and run on clusters to support high-speed processing and faster results. Databricks also has the ability to manage Spark programs for users, providing version control, collaboration tools, and allowing for easy scheduling of workflows among other useful features.
