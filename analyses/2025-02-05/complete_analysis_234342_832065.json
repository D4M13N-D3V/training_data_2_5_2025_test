Cyren security researchers, Avi Turiel and Geffen Tzur, discussed the history and current state of botnets and shared insights on malicious bot behavior, how to spot it, and what you can do to protect your organization. Some of the highlights from the discussion Whether you realize it or not, you very likely have bots in your network. During the webinar we polled our audience and 71 percent said they did not believe a bot had been detected in their organization. However, a KPMG study of mid-sized companies found that a whopping 93 percent were living with bot infections. Botnets are truly the clone armies of cybercrime and they are among the biggest internet threats of the 21st century. They deliver billions of ransomware, phishing, and spam emails every day, spreading malware, stealing data, and launching DDoS attacks. In Q3 2016 alone, Cyren estimates that botnets distributed globally an average of 56.8 billion spam and phishing emails per day. While bots use extremely complex methods to evade detection, they are surprisingly easy to set up. With only a few hundred dollars in hand and an internet connection, anyone can obtain the software and support to build a botnet. And that botnet yields a significant return on investment for the criminal botmaster.

      "user_guidance": "**Protecting Against Botnets and Ensuring Data Security: A Guide for Everyone**\n\n**Introduction: Understanding the Botnet Threat**\n\nBotnets are networks of infected devices controlled by cybercriminals to spread ransomware, phishing, spam, and launch DDoS attacks. They are a significant threat, with 93% of mid-sized companies unknowingly infected. Protecting against botnets requires proactive measures to secure your data and devices.\n\n---\n\n**1. Security Best Practices**\n\n- **Regular Software Updates**: Keep your operating system and applications updated to patch vulnerabilities.\n- **Antivirus Installation**: Use reputable antivirus software and enable automatic scans.\n- **Strong Passwords**: Use unique, complex passwords for each account and consider a password manager.\n- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate critical data from the general network to prevent spread of infections.\n\n**2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n\n- **Regular Backups**: Use external drives or cloud storage for regular backups, ensuring data is offline.\n- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data to protect it from unauthorized access.\n- **Access Control**: Limit access to sensitive information to only those who need it.\n\n**3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n\n- **Caution with Links and Downloads**: Avoid suspicious links or downloads, especially from unknown sources.\n- **Secured Networks**: Use VPNs on public Wi-Fi to encrypt internet traffic.\n- **Educate Yourself**: Stay informed about cyber threats and share knowledge with others.\n\n**4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n\n- **Phishing Attacks**: Be vigilant with emails; verify senders before clicking links or providing information.\n- **Weak Passwords**: Avoid reusing passwords and opt for multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.\n\n**5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n\n- **Data Minimization**: Share only necessary personal information online.\n- **Privacy Settings**: Adjust social media and app settings to limit data sharing.\n- **VPN Usage**: Use VPNs to protect data when using public networks.\n\n**6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n\n- **Security Incidents**: Contact IT or security professionals if you suspect a breach.\n- **Complex Threats**: Seek expert help if you encounter advanced threats or suspicious activity.\n- **Regular Audits**: Consider professional security audits for comprehensive risk assessment.\n\n---\n\nBy following these guides, you can significantly reduce the risk of botnet infections and enhance your overall data security.
