These attacks may include ransomware, adware, spyware , and more. Lately we have observed a growing trend of distributing malware through password-protected email attachments. Lets look at an example of what this kind of malware attack looks like so that you better safeguard your inbox. Related Microsoft reports a leap in attack sophistication Example of the malware attack The employee receives an email that appears to be from a trusted and well-known sender, or a common brand, with a catchy subject ex. Invoice, Payment verification, etc . The email contains an attached file that is zipped and password-protected by the attacker. The password creates the illusion the attachment must contain confidential personal information that had to be secured. The password to open the file from the zip is included in the email Example of the malicious email Field to enter the password to open the zipped emails attachment Once the password is entered and the file is opened, the user is infected by the malware . Usually, it is what is referred to as a trojan attack which is hidden within the email attachment. Learn more about industry trends, and how phishing kits work. Watch the Webinar Emotet trojan malware hidden in email attachments The Emotet trojan malware is the most common type of malware attack we see when it comes to password-protected email attachments. Its usually delivered through mail spam and phishing emails that contain infected Microsoft Word or PDF files. When opening the file, the victim is tricked into enabling the macros and triggering the malware logic. As seen in the example below, the victim opened the encrypted, zipped attachmenta Microsoft Word file. That file fakes a Microsoft Office Activation Wizard that urges the recipient to Enable Editing and  Enable Content to view and edit the file. Example of the content of the Emotet infected Microsoft Word document If the user follows the Enable Editing and Enable Content processes , they will enable the malicious macros ingrained in it. And the victim wont even notice it. The file starts to silently run a PowerShell script Decoding the script reveals a downloader code As a result, Emotet will download and execute additional malware, which will be installed directly on the victims PC and bypass all possible detection. Attacks using password-protected zip files and taking advantage of our social engineering are virtually invisible to most email filtering techniques .

      "user_guidance": "### Security Guidance: Protecting Against Malware Attacks via Email\n\nMalware attacks delivered through email, especially those using password-protected files, are a growing threat. These attacks often involve ransomware, adware, spyware, or trojans like Emotet. Below are practical security best practices, data protection recommendations, and safe usage guidelines to help you safeguard against these threats.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Easy-to-Follow Security Best Practices**\n\n1. **Verify the Sender:**\n   - Always check the sender's email address to ensure it is legitimate and familiar. Hover over links to see the actual URL before clicking.\n   - Be cautious of emails that appear to be from trusted senders but have slight variations in the domain name or unusual wording.\n\n2. **Avoid Opening Suspicious Attachments:**\n   - Do not open password-protected zip files or attachments unless you are certain they are legitimate.\n   - Be cautious of emails that claim to contain \"confidential\" or \"sensitive\" information requiring a password to access.\n\n3. **Do Not Enter Passwords in pop-ups:**\n   - If an email asks you to enter a password to open an attachment, do not comply. Legitimate organizations will not ask you to do this.\n\n4. **Enable Macro Warnings:**\n   - Disable macros in Microsoft Office by default. Only enable them if you are absolutely sure the document is safe and the macros are necessary.\n   - Be cautious of prompts like \"Enable Editing\" or \"Enable Content\" in documents.\n\n5. **Use Antivirus Software:**\n   - Ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus software installed. This can help detect and block malicious files before they cause harm.\n\n6. **Report Suspicious Emails:**\n   - If you receive a suspicious email, report it to your IT or security team immediately. Do not forward or share the email with others.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n\n1. **Regular Backups:**\n   - Regularly back up important data to an external drive or cloud storage. In case of a ransomware attack, backups can help restore your data without paying a ransom.\n\n2. **Encrypt Sensitive Data:**\n   - Use encryption for sensitive files or communications to protect them from unauthorized access.\n\n3. **Use Strong, Unique Passwords:**\n   - Use a password manager to create and store complex, unique passwords for all accounts. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple platforms.\n\n4. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**\n   - Enable MFA whenever possible, especially for email, banking, and other critical accounts. This adds an extra layer of security.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n\n1. **Be Cautious with Public Wi-Fi:**\n   - Avoid opening sensitive documents or entering passwords while connected to public Wi-Fi networks.\n\n2. **Keep Software Updated:**\n   - Regularly update your operating system, browser, and software to patch vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.\n\n3. **Avoid Sharing Personal Information:**\n   - Do not share personal or financial information in response to unsolicited emails or requests.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n\n1. **Social Engineering Attacks:**\n   - Attackers often use psychological manipulation to trick users into opening malicious files or sharing information. Stay vigilant and question unexpected requests.\n\n2. **Trojan Malware (e.g., Emotet):**\n   - These malicious files often disguise themselves as legitimate documents (e.g., invoices, PDFs, or Word files). Never enable macros in unsolicited documents.\n\n3. **Phishing Attacks:**\n   - Phishing emails are designed to look legitimate but are intended to steal data or deliver malware. Always verify the authenticity of the email before taking action.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n\n1. **Limit Personal Information Online:**\n   - Avoid sharing sensitive personal information (e.g., addresses, phone numbers, or financial details) on public platforms or in unsolicited communications.\n\n2. **Monitor Account Activity:**\n   - Regularly check your bank statements and account activity for unauthorized transactions or access.\n\n3. **Use Privacy Settings:**\n   - Adjust privacy settings on social media and online platforms to limit the amount of personal information visible to others.\n\n---\n\n### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n\n1. **Report Incidents Immediately:**\n   - If you suspect you have fallen victim to a malware attack, contact your IT or security team immediately to contain the damage.\n\n2. **Consult Security Experts:**\n   - If you receive a suspicious email or attachment and are unsure whether it is safe, seek guidance from a security professional before interacting with it.\n\n3. **Leverage Advanced Security Tools:**\n   - Use advanced email security solutions, such as Cyren Inbox Security, to continuously monitor and scan emails for threats, even after they have been delivered.\n\n---\n\n### **Signs of a Possible Malware Infection**\n\n- Unexplained changes to files or system behavior.\n- Pop-ups or unusual login requests.\n- Slow system performance.\n- Unusual account activity or unauthorized access.\n\nIf you notice any of these signs, disconnect from the internet, contact your IT team, and avoid interacting with the infected system.\n\n---\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to malware attacks delivered via email. Stay vigilant, keep your systems updated, and never hesitate to seek help if you suspect something is wrong."
