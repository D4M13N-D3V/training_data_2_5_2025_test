    "content": "product_security_features,access_management<data_protection>,privacy_policy,technical_documentation\n\nWait, there's an extra '>' in there. Let me correct that.\n\nproduct_security_features, access_management, data_protection, privacy_policy, technical_documentation\n\nBut the initial instruction says to return as a comma-separated list, so spaces are unnecessary. Also, reviewing the content again, while there's a mention of privacy, it's more about the presence of a privacy section rather than detailed privacy policies. However, since it's listed, I'll include it. \n\nBut checking again, in the original content, it says \"Privacy Management Service by Data443\" which might indicate privacy features, so it's appropriate to include privacy_policy.\n\nFinal answer:\n\nproduct_security_features,access_management,data_protection,privacy_policy,technical_documentation\n\nproduct_security_features,access_management,data_protection,privacy_policy,technical_documentation",
