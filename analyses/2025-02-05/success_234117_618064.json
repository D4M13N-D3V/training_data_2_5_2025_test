Winners were selected based on their proposals for using application programming interfaces API to enable consumers to share their personal health information safely and securely with their health care providers, family members or other caregivers. As health information technology becomes more accessible, consumers are playing an even greater role in how and when their health information is exchanged or shared, said Dr. Vindell Washington, national coordinator for health information technology. The Move Health Data Forward Challenge will help consumers unleash their health data and put it to work. Move Health Data Forward Challenge Winners The total prize amount available for the three phases of the Move Health Data Forward Challenge is 250,000, with the two finalists winning a total of 75,000. Phase 1 required a series of plans to describe the technical, operational, financial and business aspects of a proposed solution to show that participants had feasible and executable plans. Each Phase 1 winner below will receive a 5,000 award TrustedCare and ARM TrustedCare and ARM aim to develop devices that enable patients to interact with multiple providers in a secure, authenticated and auditable mannerhelping to improve coordinated care in accountable care organizations by using open standards. CedarBridge Group LLC The CareApproveTM solution allows consumers to consent to share their health information with their health care providers from their smartphone and optionally to choose which sections of information may be shared with a given provider. EMR Direct EMR Directs HealthToGo service aims to facilitate the deployment of applications that can integrate patient data from multiple data holders through software that supports scalable deployment of APIs. This will enable consumers to manage sharing of their health information, and improve the accessibility of patient health data. Foxhall Wythe LLC Docket optimizes patient-health care provider communication by empowering mobile users to securely maintain their critical health information and authorize the transmission of that information to trusted care professionals. kreateIoT, Technatomy,  Koncero The solution provides individuals with the power to both access their health information electronically and also actively direct their health informations flow to help make informed decisions through a browser on a laptop or mobile application. The team is using Substitutable Medical Apps Reusable Technologies SMART and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources FHIR to create a secure way of sharing sensitive patient data. Lush Group, Inc. The Lush Groups HealthyMePHR system allows patients to import their health information from their primary care providers electronic health record EHR system, define how it is shared with others, and authorize electronic access. Additional features will accelerate patient clinical data sharing on a patient-by-patient basis. Live and Leave Well, LLC Live and Leave Well is an end-of-life planning platform designed to help individuals create, manage and share end of life plans using API technology. SpunJohn Consultants, LLC MedGrotto gives patients an easy, simple and secure platform to store and access their complete health record while sharing with their providers andor surrogates with fully customizable access levels from any device, anytime and anywhere. Thoughtkeg Application Services Corporation MyHealthRec.com is an enhanced patient portal web application that uses modern web technologies for front-end design that is responsive to users and enables patients and their proxies to control the movement of their health data. Resilient Network Systems, Webshield  SAFE Biopharma Resilient Network Systems partnered with WebShield Inc., SAFE-BioPharma, Carebox and InterSystems to create a solution that gives consumers the ability to conveniently access and share their own health records on demand. The solution will demonstrate a unique nationwide capability to conveniently verify a consumers identity, locate and electronically request a consumers records, and deliver them to a secure cloud-based personal storage service. The ten Phase 1 winners now move to Phase 2, where up to five finalists will be awarded 20,000 each for prototypes and test performance of their solutions. Phase 2 winners will then move to Phase 3, which will award 50,000 for up to two winners each based on the participants ability to implement their solution. The Move Health Data Forward Challenge builds on ONCs work with the Health Relationship Trust HEART Workgroup security, privacy, and health information technology stakeholders collaborating to develop a set of privacy and security specifications that enable an individual to control the authorization of access to health data. These efforts are part of a larger community-driven movement toward helping individuals and clinicians benefit from the full potential of health information technology.
