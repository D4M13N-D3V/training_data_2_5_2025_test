Test backups periodically to confirm they can be restored.\n- **Update Systems**: Keep all software, operating systems, and applications up to date to patch vulnerabilities.\n- **Use Strong Passwords**: Implement complex passwords (e.g., 12+ characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols). Use a password manager to securely store credentials.\n- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add an extra layer of security for accounts by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to your phone or a biometric scan).\n- **Train Employees**: Regularly educate teams on security best practices, phishing detection, and ransomware prevention.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Data Discovery and Classification**: Use tools like Data443's **ClassiDocs** to identify and classify sensitive data (e.g., PII, financial records, or intellectual property). This helps ensure proper handling and protection.\n- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Apply encryption to data at rest and in transit.
