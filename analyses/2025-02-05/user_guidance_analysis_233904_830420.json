There are still more questions than answers regarding this new ransomware campaign , but Cyren researchers have confirmed that the malware has married a derivation of last years Petya ransomware with the wormlike EternalBlue exploit, used by WannaCry only last month to spread from computer to computer via a vulnerability in a Microsoft file sharing protocol, details of which we discussed here . Email Inbox Identified, But Now Victims Cant Get their Decryption Keys This new Petya ransomware variant asks for the equivalent of 300 in Bitcoin to be transferred to the Bitcoin address 1Mz7153HmuxXTuR2R1t78mGsdzaAtNbBWX. You can see the account details and confer how many ransom payments have been at the Blockchain page here . After sending 300 worth of Bitcoin to the address, the victim is supposed to send his Bitcoin wallet ID and his personal installation key to the address  to receive the decryption key. It has now been confirmed that the e-mail provider Posteo has blocked this address, so even if you pay, you will not get the decryption key, since the attacker will not receive the victims e-mail. How It Works THe Petya variant uses the rundll32.exe process to run itself. Files are then encrypted by a file in the Windows folder called perfc.dat Sha-256 027cc450ef5f8c5f653329641ec1fed91f694e0d229928963b30f6b0d7d3a745. Petya schedules a task to reboot the victims computer within an hour. schtasks.exe  TR CWindowssystem32shutdown.exe r f The Master Boot Record MBR is modified in such a way that the encryption is carried out, and a custom bootloader is loaded that shows the ransom note and prevents the computer from booting into the Windows operating system. Here is the ransom note that is displayed after the computer has rebooted Doesnt Use a New Extension Petya encrypts files with the following file extensions, but does not add a new extension like most ransomware today 3ds .7z .accdb .ai .asp .aspx .avhd .back .bak .c .cfg .conf .cpp .cs .ctl .dbf .disk .djvu .doc .docx .dwg .eml .fdb .gz .h .hdd .kdbx .mail .mdb .msg .nrg .ora .ost .ova .ovf .pdf .php .pmf .ppt .pptx .pst .pvi .py .pyc .rar .rtf .sln .sql .tar .vbox .vbs .vcb .vdi .vfd .vmc .vmdk .vmsd .vmx .vsdx .vsv .work .xls .xlsx .xvd .zip Cyren detects the Petya ransomware attack as W32Ransom.Petya.J!Eldorado.

Cyren does not recommend paying the ransom fee and strongly encourages users to apply the MS17-010 security patch by running Windows Update. Its also good to block port 445.

  "analysis": "### Practical Security Guidance to Protect Against Ransomware Attacks Like Petya\n\nThe 2017 Petya ransomware attack highlighted the importance of strong cybersecurity practices to prevent and respond to such threats. Below are clear, actionable recommendations to help you protect yourself and your organization from ransomware and other cyber threats:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Security Best Practices**\n   - **Keep systems and software updated**: Ensure all operating systems, software, and firmware are updated with the latest security patches. The Petya ransomware exploited the EternalBlue vulnerability in Windows systems, which could have been mitigated by applying Microsoft\u2019s MS17-010 patch.\n   - **Enable automatic updates**: Configure your devices and software to automatically install updates to avoid missed patches.\n   - **Use strong antivirus software**: Install reputable antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to detect and block malicious activity early.\n   - ** \u0111o\u1ea1n a firewall**: Enable firewalls on all devices and networks to block unauthorized access.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Backup your data regularly**: Keep multiple backups of important files, both on external drives and in the cloud. Ensure backups are stored offline or in secure, immutable storage to prevent ransomware from encrypting them.\n   - **Test backups periodically**: Verify that your backups are complete and can be restored in case of an emergency.\n   - **Use file history or snapshots**: Enable features like Windows File History or macOS Time Machine to create regular snapshots of your files.\n   - **Encrypt sensitive data**: Use encryption to protect sensitive files, both at rest and in transit.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Be cautious with emails and attachments**: Avoid opening suspicious emails or clicking on links from unknown senders. Petya and other ransomware often spread through phishing campaigns.\n   - **Avoid untrusted downloads**: Do not download software or files from unverified sources.\n   - **Disable macros in Office documents**: Malicious macros in Microsoft Office files are a common ransomware delivery method.\n   - **Use strong, unique passwords**: Protect accounts with complex passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) when possible.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Block SMB port 445**: The EternalBlue exploit used by Petya spreads via the SMB protocol (port 445). Block this port on your network or disable SMBv1 if it\u2019s not needed.\n   - **Disable unnecessary services**: Shut down unused services and protocols to reduce your attack surface.\n   - **Monitor network activity**: Use monitoring tools to detect unusualactivity that may indicate a ransomware attack.\n   - **Segment your network**: Isolate critical systems and data to prevent lateral movement in case of an infection.\n   - **Educate users**: Train employees and family members to recognize and report suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Privacy Protection Measures**\n   - **Limit app permissions**: Only grant necessary permissions to applications and services.\n   - **Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks**: Public Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured and can expose your data to attackers.\n   - **Use a VPN**: If you must use public Wi-Fi, connect through a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your traffic.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n   - **If you suspect an infection**: Immediately disconnect from the internet and contact IT or cybersecurity professionals if you suspect a ransomware attack.\n   - **After a data breach**: If your data has been compromised, consult with experts to assess the damage and recover securely.\n   - **For complex vulnerabilities**: Seek assistance from cybersecurity professionals to address advanced threats or configuration issues, such as disabling legacy protocols like SMBv1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\nThe Petya ransomware attack underscores the importance of proactive security measures to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats. Regular updates, backups, and user education are critical to minimizing risk. Always prioritize caution when interacting with emails, downloads, and links, and seek professional help if you encounter suspicious activity or a confirmed attack.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to ransomware and other cyber threats. Stay vigilant and remember: prevention is always better than paying a ransom!"
