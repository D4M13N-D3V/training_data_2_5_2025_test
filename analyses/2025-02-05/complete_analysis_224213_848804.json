This technology can analyze billions of messages per day  identifying outbreaks the moment they occur. To provide accurate protection from lower volume local or regional outbound spam, a local instance of RPD is deployed with each Outbound Anti-Spam Engine. RPD then analyzes the traffic to provide spam and phishing classifications based on its unique global view of outbreaks. Outbound emails are scanned by the Anti-Spam Outbound engine for global and locally recurring patterns. This helps to identify spam, phishing, and email-borne malware while also tracking each senders traffic statistics, such as mails per time period. Once a sender crosses a threshold, a notification is then sent along with the sender address. Samples of the blocked emails are then provided for analysis during the remediation process.
