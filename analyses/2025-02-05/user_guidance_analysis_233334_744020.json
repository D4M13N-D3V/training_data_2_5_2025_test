While there are similarities to the Necurs-distributed Locky ransomware, Scarab seems to have been developed by a different malware author. Necurs began actively distributing Scarab on November 23rd Thanksgiving Day in the U.S.. Cyrens security cloud blocked 13.3 million emails containing the Scarab attachment that day. Ransomware-as-a-Service Necurs most recent scourge has similarities on the surface to earlier Necurs-connected ransomware. Analysts at the Cyren Security Lab note that the Visual Basic .vbs file that downloads the malicious content is similar to the downloads from Locky and Trickbot. But upon examining the actual Scarab ransomware see our How It Works breakdown below, appears very different from Locky, with indications that it was created by a different author. One of the most notable differences includes the lack of a TOR webpage for a ransom fee. Instead you send an email to  with the personal identifier. This suggests that the criminals behind the Necurs botnet might be offering a distribution service for ransomware authors, with the Necurs gang providing the .vbs file that downloads the ransomware payload, macros, and JavaScript. This approach enables the malware author to focus on developing the ransomware itself. What economic arrangement the two parties might have, we can only guess at. Cyren detects the Scarab files as the following EXE file  W32Ransom.Scarab.A Sha-256 7a60e9f0c00bcf5791d898c84c26f484b4c671223f6121dc3608970d8bf8fe4f VBS file  VBSDownldr.HM Sha-256 e6715117fd6995fafe48a3a60a2b1275ef21a63f7878de2cc031c8f1a0e5d771 Necurs A Brief History Its the botnet that keeps on giving. Known for its technical complexity, diverse distributions, and exceptional persistence, Necurs is one of the largest if not the largest botnets in the world, estimated to have up to 6 million bots networked. Its been behind the distribution of ransomwares like Locky and banking trojans like Dridex and Trickbot. Necurs periodically goes into hibernation, with little or no activitythen bang. For example, in 2016, the botnet went on hiatus for three weeks after the arrest of 50 Russian cyber criminals connected to a banking trojan, several of whom were believed to be behind Necurs operation. The botnet went quiet again in early 2017, but reactivated in March 2017 and has been active to varying degrees since then. How Scarab Works When the email arrives, the victim sees a subject line and attachment that appear to come from a variety of scanning sources, such as HP, Epson, and Lexmark. The email itself is targeted at businesses and spoofs the HP, Epson, or Lexmark domain name, so it appears to be coming from a printer located at the business. Figure 1 Scarab email attachment captured by Cyren appears as a scanned image from an HP printer. The Scarab emails each contain a .7zip file as an attachment. Extracting the file gives you a .vbs file that, in turn, downloads JHgd476.txt from one of these locations httpmiamirecyclecenters.comJHgd476 httpmiamirecyclecenters.comJHgd476 httphellonwheelsthemovie.comJHgd476 httphard-grooves.comJHgd476? Figure 2 Scarab encrypts files and appends each with ..scarab. The JHgd476.txt file is actually an .exe file with the extension .txt to help hide its true intent. Once downloaded, the .vbs then runs the .exe that is the Scarab ransomware. Once the ransomware payload has executed, the victim sees the following message on their computer screen Figure 3 Scarab uses a Visual Basic attachment to deliver the ransomware payload. This version of Scarab encrypts the files and appends the file name with a ..scarab extension. Figure 4 Victims are asked to email  and pay the ransom in bitcoins.. Several other notable things stand out with Scarab. First, the ransom note contains no monetary sum, only the instructions to contact the  address. In addition, while Cyren detected the 13.3 million Scarab emails as primarily targeting businesses, the distribution day of Thursday, November 23rd, Thanksgiving Day, in the United States, meant that if the ransomware made it into email boxes, the vast majority of American business employees likely didnt actually see the email until they returned to work five days later. Dont Be a Victim An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, as they say. To avoid falling victim to ransomware scams like Scarab, consider using Cyrens cloud-based email security and web security capable of identifying and blocking threats as they emerge, before they reach users.

  "analysis": "**End-User Guidance on Data Security and Protection: Preventing Scarab Ransomware Attacks**\n\n**1. Understanding the Threat: Scarab Ransomware**\n\nScarab ransomware is spread through phishing emails, often impersonating brands like HP, Epson, or Lexmark. These emails contain malicious attachments that, when opened, download ransomware, encrypting your files and demanding a ransom.\n\n**2. Email Safety Tips**\n\n- **Verify Senders**: Check the sender's email address carefully. Don't rely on the display name alone.\n- **Avoid Suspicious Attachments**: Don't open attachments from unexpected emails, especially those from unknown senders.\n- **Be Cautious with Links**: Hover over links to check the URL before clicking. Avoid downloading attachments from unfamiliar sources.\n\n**3. Data Backups: Your Safety Net**\n\n- **3-2-1 Backup Rule**: Keep three copies of your data on two different media, with one copy offsite (e.g., cloud storage).\n- **Regular Backups**: Schedule regular backups to ensure data is current and recoverable.\n- **Test Backups**: Periodically test backups to ensure they can be restored effectively.\n\n**4. Keep Software Updated**\n\n- **Regular Updates**: Install security patches promptly for operating systems and applications.\n- **Enable Automatic Updates**: Let your devices update automatically to protect against vulnerabilities.\n\n**5. User Education and Phishing Simulations**\n\n- **Training**: Engage in regular security training to recognize phishing attempts.\n- **Simulations**: Conduct phishing simulations to test awareness and improve vigilance.\n\n**6. Antivirus and Anti-Ransomware Tools**\n\n- **Install Protective Software**: Use reputable antivirus and anti-ransomware tools.\n- **Keep Software Updated**: Ensure your security software receives regular updates.\n\n**7. Restrict Macros in Office Applications**\n\n- **Disable Macros**: Prevent macros from running automatically from the internet unless necessary.\n- **Adjust Settings**: Set your applications to warn you before enabling macros.\n\n**8. Regular Security Audits**\n\n- **Vulnerability Checks**: Periodically audit systems for vulnerabilities.\n- **Monitor Backups**: Ensure backups are secure and accessible.\n\n**9. Caution with Links and Attachments**\n\n- **Verify Sources**: Be wary of links and attachments from unknown sources.\n- **Report Suspicious Emails**: Inform IT about suspicious emails to prevent further attacks.\n\n**10. Monitor for Suspicious Activity**\n\n- **Watch for Red Flags**: Look for signs like unusual file encryption or access issues.\n- **Act Quickly**: Report any issues promptly to minimize damage.\n\n**11. Never Pay the Ransom**\n\n- **Avoid Payment**: Paying the ransom doesn't guarantee file recovery and supports cybercrime.\n- **Report Incidents**: Contact authorities and your organization\u2019s IT department.\n\n**12. Seek Professional Help When Needed**\n\n- **Incident Response**: If attacked, seek help from IT or security experts.\n- **Expert Mitigation**: Professionals can help restore systems and mitigate damage.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to Scarab ransomware and enhance your overall data security. Stay vigilant and proactive in protecting your digital assets."
