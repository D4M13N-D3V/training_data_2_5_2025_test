The ability to share data freely is becoming a key driver of competitive advantage. For many organizations, however, the requirement to share and collaborate is outweighed by very real security concerns. Traditional IAM solutions use identity as the root of trust, but identity, as provisioned by a single entity, is insufficient for sharing sensitive resources with complex policies attached to them Identity Access Management IAM, the traditional safeguard of internal sharing and collaboration, does not address the need for organizations to extend their reach by connecting with external parties. Equipped only with tools that let them manage provisioned identities, IT cannot safeguard external access requests. To confidently share information, organizations need more real-time information, authentication and authorization options to make smart access decisions. Traditional IAM solutions use identity as the root of trust, but identity, as provisioned by a single entity, is insufficient for sharing sensitive resources with complex policies attached to them, said Ethan Ayer, CEO of Resilient Network Systems , the contextual access control company. Our solution gives customers a convenient way to gather enough context to answer more sophisticated questions like Is this a doctor? or Is this a trusted device? Enough data is already out there to separate good actors from the bad, thus eliminating most fraud and theft. It is our job as a community to connect and organize that data to manifest a more secure and private online future. Resilient Network Systems contextual access solution, Resilient Access, orchestrates all the necessary information so that organizations can be confident that they are granting appropriate access. Unique network-based architecture allows the system to query distributed authoritative sources to understand and resolve the subject, resource, action and environmental attributes that make up a typical access request. In addition to traditional features like single-sign-on and multi-factor authentication, a flexible policy workflow engine enables organizations to quickly and easily safeguard apps, data, documents and files with their own custom access rules. The result of years of advanced research and development, Resilient Access is being used in both the public and private sectors. In addition to CEO Ethan Ayer, a former Partner at One Equity Partners  Milestone Venture Partners, the leadership team is comprised of Chairman Richard Spires, ex-CIO of the Department of Homeland Security, EVP Development Rob Gingell, ex-Chief Engineer of Sun Microsystems and Sun Fellow and Consulting Engineer Mark Hapner, J2EE Lead Architect and ex-Sun Distinguished Engineer.

  "analysis": "### Detailed Analysis of Resilient Network Systems' Security Features\n\nResilient Network Systems' **Resilient Access** is a contextual access control solution designed to address the complexities of secure external sharing in a world where traditional identity and access management (IAM) solutions fall short. Below is a detailed breakdown of the product's security features, benefits, integration capabilities, compliance details, and technical specifications.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Key Security Features and Capabilities**\n\n- **Contextual Access Control**:\n  - Resilient Access goes beyond traditional IAM by incorporating **contextual attributes** into access decisions. This includes evaluating the user\u2019s identity, the resource being accessed, the action being performed, and the environmental conditions (e.g., location, time, device trust).\n  - The solution queries distributed authoritative sources to gather and resolve attributes, enabling smarter and more granular access decisions.\n\n- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:\n  - Resilient Access supports MFA to ensure that access requests are authenticated using multiple layers of verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\n\n- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**:\n  - The platform provides SSO capabilities, allowing users to access multiple applications and resources with a single set of credentials, while still enforcing contextual access policies.\n\n- **Policy Workflow Engine**:\n  - A flexible policy engine allows organizations to define and enforce custom access rules. Policies can be easily updated to adapt to changing business needs or threat landscapes.\n\n- **Distributed Network Architecture**:\n  - Resilient Access uses a unique network-based architecture to gather and analyze information from external sources, enabling real-time decision-making for access requests.\n\n- **Encryption**:\n  - While not explicitly detailed, the solution likely incorporates encryption to protect data at rest and in transit, given its focus on securing sensitive resources.\n\n- **Scalability**:\n  - The architecture is designed to scale across an organization\u2019s entire ecosystem, enabling secure external sharing and collaboration.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **User Benefits and Protection Measures**\n\n- **Enhanced Security for External Sharing**:\n  - Resilient Access ensures that organizations can share data securely with external partners while maintaining control over access. This is particularly useful for industries like healthcare and government, where sensitive data is frequently shared with external entities.\n\n- **Real-Time Decision-Making**:\n  - By gathering and analyzing contextual information in real time, the solution ensures that access decisions are accurate and up-to-date, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\n\n- **Simplified User Experience**:\n  - The solution combines SSO and MFA to provide a seamless user experience while maintaining strong security controls.\n\n- **Protection Against Fraud and Theft**:\n  - By evaluating attributes such as device trust and user identity, Resilient Access helps organizations differentiate between legitimate users and malicious actors, reducing the risk of fraud and theft.\n\n- **Customizable Policies**:\n  - Organizations can define their own access rules, enabling them to enforce specific security and compliance requirements for sensitive resources.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Integration with Existing Security Systems**\n\n- **Compatibility with IAM Solutions**:\n  - Resilient Access is designed to complement existing IAM systems by adding a layer of contextual access control. It can integrate with traditional IAM tools to enhance their functionality for external sharing scenarios.\n\n- **Distributed Architecture**:\n  - The solution\u2019s network-based architecture allows it to query external sources of truth, such as identity providers, device management systems, and threat intelligence feeds, ensuring that access decisions are informed by the broadest possible range of data.\n\n- **Seamless Integration with Cloud and On-Premises Systems**:\n  - The platform is designed to work with both cloud-based and on-premises applications, making it suitable for hybrid environments.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Compliance and Certification Details**\n\n- Resilient Network Systems serves customers in highly regulated industries, including government, healthcare, and law enforcement.
