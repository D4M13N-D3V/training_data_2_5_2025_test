Under the guise of recognized web payment and productivity tool requests, hackers lure potential victims into clicking on fake email links that are designed to steal credentials or download ransomware. Hackers often disguise these email requests as directives from upper management, knowing that most employees take email security for granted and will click the link. And while most traditional email security systems offer spam filtering and anti-virus protection, they arent fully equipped to guard your employees from todays most prevalent internet threatphishing attacks. 43 of SMBs surveyed suffered a phishing breach this past year A recent study commissioned by Cyren and conducted by Osterman Research found phishing attacks to be the most successful against small- to medium-sized businesses from 100 to 3,000 employees, with 43 suffering a phishing breach in the last 12 months and 75 reporting concern, or extreme concern, about malware infiltration through emailthe 1 ranked concern.

It only takes one employee to open an unknown email and download a malware attachment with a phishing URL to launch a ransomware attack, with an average loss of 25,000 to 75,000 per scam. Consider also that 25 of phishing sites disappear within 2 hours of their emergenceslow-moving threat updates to email security appliances are no match for such fast-moving threats. Phishing URLs were up 22 in Q3 2016 According to Cyren GlobalView TM Security Cloud threat data, phishing URLs recently jumped 22, with a net addition of nearly 1 million new phishing sites during Q3 2016. Meanwhile, email malware is up by a whopping 59 in Q3 2016, compared to Q2 2016. Thats a 10x year-to-date jump, due principally to consistent campaigns of Locky ransomware lasting five days of every week of Q3 2016.
