This seasons scams run the gamut, from traditional taxpayer phishing scams to more sophisticated fraud involving data stolen from accountants and tax preparers. Tax Preparers Are a Key Leverage Point Tax accountants and preparers are an obvious point of potential leverage for tax fraudsters. The IRS recently released a specific warning urging tax professionals to increase their level of cyber security and watch for emails carrying malware aimed at stealing client data. The scam works by first breaching the computer files belonging to tax accountants. The criminals steal the tax preparers client data, and then file a fake return with the IRS, using the taxpayers real bank account information to have the return deposited. The criminals then contact the victim and pretend to be the IRS or a debt collection agency, informing the victim that the deposit was made in error and they must redirect the deposit back to the IRSin reality a different bank account owned by the criminal.

Phishing for Tax Tool Credentials Phishing remains one of the most common tax fraud techniques, so learning how to identify phishing links can be helpful. In another recent scam reported by the IRS , this phishing scam attempts to steal passwords and data by tricking tax professionals into signing a new but fake e-Services user agreement a legitimate online tool for tax professionals from the IRS . One examplein a fake email claiming to be from e-Services Registration, and using the subject line of Important Update about Your e-Services Account, the phishing email informs the tax preparer that We are rolling out a new user agreement and all registered users must accept its revised terms to have access to e-Services and its products. The scam then uses a link to redirect the victim to a fake site to review and accept the agreement. While on the site, the victim is asked to provide user names and passwords. Human Resources Staff are Prized Targets In another increasingly common email scam, human resources staff are often targeted with emails impersonating the CEO and requesting copies of all the employee W-2 forms. Once the criminals have copies of the forms, theyll either use the data to file fraudulent tax returns or sell the data on the Dark Web. Example of a phishing email sent to the head of HR, impersonating the companys CEO. But Taxpayers Still the Main Target However, taxpayers still remain the number one target of cybercriminals during tax season. Many of these types of scams arrive in the victims email with an attached document containing instructions and links to phishing websites. Cyren identified two recent such scams, you can read about them here and here . Once the victim clicks the URL, he or she is often redirected to a website that goes to great lengths to appear legitimate, such as the one below, a tax refund-stealing site in Malaysia. Fraudulent phishing web site to steal tax refunds in Malaysia The victim then clicks his financial institutions logo and gets redirected to another fake banking site, where he or she is asked to provide sensitive information, including their user name, password, and bank account number. In a slightly different scheme, criminals attempt to trick the recipient into opening a PDF by suggesting that the victims tax refund information is now available for viewing. Once the email is opened, the victim is encouraged to click a link which redirects to a phishing site seeking the victims personal credentials. Report suspicious activity If you or someone you know receives an email claiming to be from a government tax authority, Cyren urges you to immediately report the activity to the appropriate government agency. In the United States, you can report the crime to both federal and local authorities. More information on reporting resources can be found here on the IRS tax scams page. Doveryai, no proveryai  and get your defenses in order With individuals and companies around the globe becoming targets and victims of tax refund scams, it is critical to implement strong email gateway security which can prevent phishing emails from reaching users in the first place. Strong time-of-click and web gateway security also block access to phishing links as a separate layer of protection. Naturally, all businesses should remind their employees that most major government tax authorities, including the U.S. Internal Revenue Service IRS, will never Email, text message, or call them to verify their identity by asking for personal and financial information. Email, text message, or call them to demand immediate payment. Request credit or debit card numbers via email, text message, or over the phone or require them to use a specific payment method to pay taxes, such as a prepaid debit card.

    "content": "**End-User Guidance on Data Security and Protection During Tax Season**\n\nAs tax season approaches, it\u2019s critical to remain vigilant against cybercriminals targeting sensitive personal and financial information. Below are practical, easy-to-follow security recommendations to help protect yourself and your organization from tax-related scams and data breaches.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Security Best Practices**\n- **Recognize Phishing Attempts**: Be cautious of unsolicited emails, texts, or calls claiming to be from the IRS or other tax authorities. These often contain malicious links or attachments designed to steal your credentials or personal information.\n- **Verify Requests**: Never provide personal or financial information without confirming the identity of the requester. Legitimate organizations like the IRS will not call, email, or text you to demand immediate payment or request sensitive details.\n- **Use Strong Passwords**: Protect your tax software, email, and financial accounts with unique, complex passwords. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible.\n- **Keep Software Updated**: Ensure your operating system, tax preparation software, and security tools are up to date to protect against vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Secure Tax Documents**: Keep physical and digital tax records in a safe, encrypted location. Use a secure file-sharing service when sending tax documents to your preparer.\n- **Back Up Data**: Regularly back up sensitive data to an encrypted external drive or cloud storage service. Ensure backups are stored in a secure location.\n- **Limit Access**: Only share sensitive information with trusted individuals or organizations. Avoid using public Wi-Fi to file taxes or access financial accounts.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Avoid Suspicious Links and Attachments**: Do not click on links or open attachments from unfamiliar senders, especially those claiming to be from the IRS or your bank. These may lead to phishing websites or malware.\n- **Check Email Sources**: Look for red flags in emails, such as poor grammar, urgent tone, or mismatched sender addresses. Legitimate tax authorities rarely send unsolicited emails.\n- **Validate Requests**: If you receive a request for sensitive information, contact the organization directly using a verified phone number or website.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Phishing Scams**: Cybercriminals may impersonate tax professionals, HR departments, or the IRS to steal credentials or sensitive data. Look out for emails or websites that seem legitimate but ask for unnecessary information.\n- **Fake IRS Communications**: Scammers may claim you owe back taxes, demand payment, or threaten legal action. Remember, the IRS typically communicates through mail, not email or text.\n- **W-2 Scams**: Be cautious of emails impersonating your CEO or other executives requesting employee W-2 forms. Verify the request through a separate communication channel.\n\nTo prevent these risks:\n  - Use email filtering and anti-phishing tools.\n  - Educate employees on how to identify and report suspicious activity.\n  - Monitor accounts for unauthorized transactions.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Monitor Credit Reports**: Check your credit report regularly to detect unauthorized activity. You can request free credit reports from annualcreditreport.com.\n- **Avoid Public Wi-Fi**: Do not file taxes or access financial accounts using public Wi-Fi, as it may not be secure.\n- **Enable Privacy Settings on Devices**: Use encryption and enable privacy features on your computer, smartphone, and other devices.\n\n---\n\n### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- If you suspect your data has been compromised (e.g., you receive a phishing email or notice unauthorized account activity), contact your IT department or a cybersecurity professional immediately.\n- Report tax-related scams to the IRS (see their [Tax Scams page](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-scams-consumer-alerts) for reporting resources).\n- Consider hiring a reputable cybersecurity firm to assess your organization\u2019s defenses, especially if you handle sensitive client data.\n\n---\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to tax-related scams and protect your sensitive information.
