If you follow this blog, you c a nt help but notice that CIS and our incident response team still detect and remediate a lot of email threats that arent caught by Microsoft 365, Office 365 features, such as Safe Attachments , or a Secure Email Gateway. Related Microsoft reports a leap in attack sophistication Yesterday , I rolled up my sleeves and looked at a few phishing emails that hit a prospective customer. What I found was attacks dont have to be sophisticated to evade detection by traditional layers of security. Advanced Persistent Threats are really just Persistent Threats The messages were html formatted to look like A mazon order confirmations , but there were no URLs and no attachments. The intent is to get the user to call the phone number in the email. Whats interesting is everything changes with each instance of the message . Different sender information. Different routing. Different content. Different phone number. Looking at the email headers , I saw the presence of the Authentication-Results header showing that SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are enabled. Looking deeper, I noticed one message hard- failed SPF and the other was a soft fail ure . Both messages were DKIM signed. Only one asserted a DMARC policy. Sothe question is why arent organizations enforcing basic email authentication like SPF  DKIM ? The reason is because organizations are ignoring or misconfiguring these settings. The takeaway is that basic email authentication protocols would prevent some basic phishing threats even ones that are sophisticated in their simplicity but enforcing these mechanisms would negatively impact delivery of legitimate email because people are lazy, not properly trained, forgetful, too busy, etc. Of course, a domain set up with the intent of sending spam or phishing can set up the authentication mechanisms to pass, but many do not. Additionally, a bad actor can easily spoof a domain and not be detected if these authentication mechanisms are not being enforced by the receiving MTA. Li ke Shrek told us, life is layers. This is just another example of why no single security control can detect all email threats. The idea is to layer security solutions .
