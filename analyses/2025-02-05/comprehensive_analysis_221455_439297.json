This case study is an interesting example that elaborates on how Data443s technology protects users from malicious content. The Anatomy of a Sophisticated Spam Attack Recently, the Data443 team analyzed a far-reaching spam campaign covering multiple countries and languages that placed adult dating and online dating at the top of the list. There were several fronts on which this attack was significant Multi-lingual approach the spam emails were in English, Swedish, and German with a great number in the latter two languages.

Abnormally high volume for such attacks  Data443 detected close to 123,000 spam emails within a 7-day period, all targeting their customers. While this number might not be considered exceptionally high for general spam, it represents a significant volume specifically for this targeted attack. Shifting tactics Over 40 HTML and CSS code versions were deployed by the attackers in an effort to stay off the radar. Primarily, that was through incessant modification of template designs, texts, and images. Data443s Spam Detection in Action The sophisticated attack was timely identified and blocked due to the high effectiveness of Data443s spam detection system. Their solution handled this challenge in the following ways Content AnalysisMulti-lingual A system that could analyze content in multiple languages, be it English, Swedish, or German, brought forth the necessity of ascertaining any spam pattern, regardless of the language being used. Pattern Recognition Even though the attackers were trying to change the HTML and CSS code, there was an underlying structure and content to the emails that Data443s system was able to pick out. Volume Analysis In this case, Data443 analyzed email traffic patterns and found abnormal spikes in volume. The graph started off with peaks of 6,000 or so emails every 3 hours, gradually stabilizing at approximately 2,000 emails per 3-hour period. Still, that is a high volume, and its not possible to know if it will increase or decrease Image Content Analysis It noticed the variation in the types of images used, from only nude pictures in the first day and a half to nude and non-nude images.
