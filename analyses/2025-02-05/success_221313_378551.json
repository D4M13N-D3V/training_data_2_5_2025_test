These attacks may include ransomware, adware, spyware , and more. Lately we have observed a growing trend of distributing malware through password-protected email attachments. Lets look at an example of what this kind of malware attack looks like so that you better safeguard your inbox. Related Microsoft reports a leap in attack sophistication Example of the malware attack The employee receives an email that appears to be from a trusted and well-known sender, or a common brand, with a catchy subject ex. Invoice, Payment verification, etc . The email contains an attached file that is zipped and password-protected by the attacker. The password creates the illusion the attachment must contain confidential personal information that had to be secured. The password to open the file from the zip is included in the email Example of the malicious email Field to enter the password to open the zipped emails attachment Once the password is entered and the file is opened, the user is infected by the malware . Usually, it is what is referred to as a trojan attack which is hidden within the email attachment. Learn more about industry trends, and how phishing kits work. Watch the Webinar Emotet trojan malware hidden in email attachments The Emotet trojan malware is the most common type of malware attack we see when it comes to password-protected email attachments. Its usually delivered through mail spam and phishing emails that contain infected Microsoft Word or PDF files. When opening the file, the victim is tricked into enabling the macros and triggering the malware logic. As seen in the example below, the victim opened the encrypted, zipped attachmenta Microsoft Word file. That file fakes a Microsoft Office Activation Wizard that urges the recipient to Enable Editing and  Enable Content to view and edit the file. Example of the content of the Emotet infected Microsoft Word document If the user follows the Enable Editing and Enable Content processes , they will enable the malicious macros ingrained in it. And the victim wont even notice it. The file starts to silently run a PowerShell script Decoding the script reveals a downloader code As a result, Emotet will download and execute additional malware, which will be installed directly on the victims PC and bypass all possible detection. Attacks using password-protected zip files and taking advantage of our social engineering are virtually invisible to most email filtering techniques .
