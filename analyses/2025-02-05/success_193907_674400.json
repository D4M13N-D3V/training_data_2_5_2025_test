Data443 or the Company OTCPK ATDS, a leading data security and privacy software company, today announced record operational and financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2020, and for its first half of fiscal year 2020. Management Commentary Jason Remillard, CEO of Data443, commented, Todays results for the first half of 2020 truly highlights the strength of our team, the quality of our product offerings, and the priority positioning of our industry. Even in this challenging and unprecedented time of pandemic, we have proven that we continue to serve our clients and grow our business, highlighting the urgency and value of our technology offerings. Our name brand global multinational clients, as well as our regular mom and pop clients, rely on Data443 for their most sensitive and important data privacy needs. Our performance is strong evidence of the important role we play in the security and success of our clients. We have continued to execute on our business plan, building momentum on both sales and product development. We secured new contracts with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Miami Dolphins, opening a Company initiative to expand our offerings to sports teams. We also successfully launched our Zoom Chat Privacy canner and our WordPress Privacy Badge, both of which have shown great momentum for us in the early going. We anticipate that customer growth overall will continue to improve as more data-driven demands shift from central offices to more home and remote-based work settings. For the greater part of 2020, we have dedicated significant time and resources to build our internal infrastructure, including our Data Center capabilities and direct to consumer capabilities. We continue to realize the benefits of product and technology investments made in 2018 and 2019. This is reflected in our continued growth of our deferred revenues, and our continued extinguishment of short and long-term debt. Our advanced infrastructure will scale to ensure we can service our continued expanding client base. We look forward to building on our relationships with ZM and the NFL  in conjunction with our existing financial and public services, government and cloud service providers. As we start the second half of 2020, our new advisory board member will continue to have special significance for us, and is already garnering benefits with analysts and customers alike. I will be holding a business update conference call on Wednesday, August 12 th at 430PM ET to provide greater detail on our plans for the rest of 2020 and going forward. I believe that Data443 is in the best positioning of its relatively short history, and we have an impressive story to tell, concluded Mr. Remillard.
