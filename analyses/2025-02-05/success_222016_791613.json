Keep Up-To-Date With The Latest Phishing Techniques Hackers are constantly inventing new techniques for phishing. Without the knowledge of these ever-changing phishing techniques, users can easily fall prey. Enterprises must make sure their employees are engaged in awareness drives, while also deploying countermeasures for potential attacks. 2. Think Twice Before Clicking Clicking links in random or suspicious emails can be a costly mistake. If unsuspecting users enter their details on a phishing website, hackers can gain access to these private credentials  meaning one must really think twice before clicking on links. One simple way to check this, though not foolproof, is hovering over links before clicking them to see if there is a preview link. 3.

Check Your Online Accounts Regularly One should check in with their online accounts regularly.

Additionally, checking bank account statements is important. 7. Keeping Browsers Up-To-Date Hackers work hard to discover and exploit security loopholes in browsers in order to carry out hyper-targeted phishing attacks. This is a reason popular browsers release security patches often. 8. Use Firewalls Internet users need to deploy firewalls in order to keep  systems inaccessible for cybercriminals. There are desktop firewalls and network firewalls. The former is a software, while the latter is an anti phishing solution hardware. These firewalls are a buffer between the user, computer, and any outside intruders. 9. Avoid Pop-Ups Pop-ups are often linked to malware in attempted phishing attacks.
