Here were some of the highlights from our discussion. Recovering From Successful Attacks Are Painful We identified we had a lot of users that were making silly mistakes and it was costing our company time and money. This is when we decided to implement Security Awareness Training. In the beginning, it was clear that Damian and his team had a reactive approach to email security and incident response. Everything was post event, meaning after a user had clicked something they shouldnt have, costing them a lot of resources to clean up successful attacks. In the recent Osterman report , it takes an average of 175 hours to recover from a successful attack, making it a top concern for security leaders moving forward. Security Training Help or Hinder? Damian implemented security awareness training to help educate and stop his users from getting phished. Whilst they solved the problem of reducing the number of breaches, it created other problems. Damian said it significantly increased the number of reported messages and soon they became overwhelmed with alerts.  One of my customers, a long-term friend of mine says, Hey, what happened to that email I sent you? The ticket I clicked that button on that one email. Was it dangerous? Was it Safe? The Osterman report , indicates that only 22 of organizations investigate all messages reported as suspicious and 84 of organizations saw security awareness training significantly increased the number of tickets  alerts. Security awareness training has created a culture of fear, causing users to forward messages to SOCs to prevent being a victim of an attack. Analysts Are Losing The Battle Damian hired a full-time analyst just to investigate suspicious emails but soon come to realize they needed additional help. My analyst who was doing all the research on these emails, he was the one who is being burned out and I realized that he is losing this battle. Alert fatigue and burnout are a real problem in the industry resulting in delayed, missed or ignored responses to reported messages. On average, organizations spend 5,111 hours per year investigating and remediating email threats at a total operation cost of U.S 311,154 based on average security analyst salary plus benefits for USA U.K 107,959 based on average security analyst salary plus benefits for U.K Try our incident response calculator to find how much it costs your organization to respond to email threats.
