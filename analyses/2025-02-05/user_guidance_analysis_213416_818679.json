Download Free Explore the Features of Data Hound Agentless Tool Designed To Help Organizations To Quantify Risks Capture Statistics See a summary of all results from your scan, including unique files and system-generated files that are automatically considered trivial. File breakdown via dashboard reporting See your files broken down into several ways, including file growth over time, how old the files are and the size and type of file present. Find file duplication Get the breakdown of how many files have no duplicates, are original files, or how many files are exact duplicate files for better data management. Find all sensitive files across your environment We have over 1,200 sophisticated rules taxonomy in 40 languages to identify sensitive content with the ability to select up to five policies at once to identify documents containing PII, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GLBA and many more sensitive data patterns. How do we do it? Case Study The remainder of the report includes a content analysis report with graphs for Through our years of experience, it has become evident that the Document Type of a record will drive many of these concerns and the actions taken to secure sensitive information. Each Document type will have a level of risk associated with it based on the usual contents of that document type. By using policies to identify the document type, the usual level of risk, whether that document type tends to contain PII, and analyzing the file location, we can create a Document Profile and score. Using these profiles and policies within the Data Identification Manager tool, each repository can be scanned and have a score determined. Using these outputs, the business you can make a meaningful correlation to the document type profile of Security, Sensitivity, Personal Data, and ROT.

  "analysis": "### Security Guidance for Data Protection and Privacy\n\nTo help you protect your data effectively, follow these practical guidelines:\n\n1. **Security Best Practices**\n   - **Regular Data Audits**: Use tools like Data Hound to perform regular scans to identify sensitive data across all platforms, including cloud storage and endpoints.\n   - **Data Classification**: Classify data based on sensitivity to prioritize protection efforts. Use Data Hound\u2019s profiling to assess risk levels.\n   - **Access Control**: Restrict data access to only those who need it. Implement password policies and use multi-factor authentication.\n   - **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to safeguard against unauthorized access.\n\n2. **Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Backup Regularly**: Schedule daily encrypted backups of critical data, storing them securely offsite or in the cloud.\n   - **Secure Storage**: Use encryption for sensitive files stored in the cloud or on local drives.\n   - **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Implement DLP tools to monitor and block unauthorized data transfers through email or other channels.\n   - **Data Cleanup**: Regularly remove redundant, obsolete, or trivial (ROT) data to minimize exposure risks.\n\n3. **Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Employee Training**: Provide training on data handling to prevent accidental exposure. Ensure awareness of phishing and social engineering tactics.\n   - **Approved Channels**: Instruct employees to use only official communication tools and avoid consumer-grade apps for sensitive data.\n   - **Data Handling**: Advise employees to verify the identity of recipients before sharing sensitive information and to avoid using public Wi-Fi for such transfers.\n\n4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Unauthorized Access**: Mitigate with multi-factor authentication (MFA) and regular access reviews.\n   - **Data Leaks**: Use DLP tools and educate employees to prevent leaks through email or USB drives.\n   - **Insider Threats**: Monitor user activity and implement strict access controls to reduce risks.\n   - **Outdated Policies**: Regularly review and update security policies to stay compliant and effective.\n\n5. **Privacy Protection Measures**\n   - **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data and retain it only as long as required by compliance standards.\n   - **Data Anonymization**: Where possible, anonymize or pseudonymize data to reduce privacy risks.\n   - **Privacy Audits**: Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with regulations and identify vulnerabilities.\n   - **User Consent**: Manage consent effectively and ensure transparent communication about data usage and sharing practices.\n\n6. **When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n   - **Security Breach**: If a breach occurs, activate your incident response plan and consider professional forensic analysis.\n   - **Compliance Uncertainty**: Consult experts if uncertain about meeting regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA.\n   - **Advanced Threats**: Engage security specialists to address sophisticated threats or suspicious activities.\n   - **Infrastructure Changes**: Seek expert advice during significant changes, such as cloud migrations or infrastructure upgrades.\n\nBy following these guidelines, organizations can enhance their security posture and protect sensitive information effectively."
