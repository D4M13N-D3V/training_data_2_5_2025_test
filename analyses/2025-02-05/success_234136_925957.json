There are reports of disruption at the likes of British National Health Service medical centers, German Railway ticket computers, FedEx and Telefonica, which apparently ordered employees to disconnect their computers from the corporate network in an attempt to stymie the spread of the ransomware . WannaCrypt encrypts files found on the system and initially demands ransom payment of 300 in Bitcoin to specific addresses, with the payment demand amount reportedly escalating over time. Global map showing WannaCrypt infections on Day 1 How Its Spreading Of particular note is how WannaCrypt is spreading. Unlike most ransomware, which is delivered via email, WannaCrypt has worm-like capabilities, and will infect any open remote desktop session specifically using Microsofts Remote Desktop Protocol on the infected machine using a known NSA exploit called ETERNALBLUE, which was leaked by the hacking group The Shadow Brokers on April 14. The ETERNALBLUE exploit is used to spread the WannaCrypt ransomware leveraging a Windows SMBv1 protocol vulnerability that was patched by Microsoft in March  but evidently many, many governmental institutions, businesses and individuals have yet to install the patch. How WannaCrypt Works After a system has been infected with the WannaCrypt ransomware, the installer will extract an embedded resource in the same folder that is a password protected zip file wcry.zip. The zip file contains files that the ransomware uses and executes. WannaCrypt will also download a TOR client to communicate with the WannaCrypt C2 servers gx7ekbenv2riucmf.onion cwwnhwhlz52maqm7.onion 76jdd2ir2embyv47.onion 57g7spgrzlojinas.onion xxlvbrloxvriy2c5.onion What Files are Encrypted WannaCrypt will encrypt files with the following extension .der, .pfx, .key, .crt, .csr, .p12, .pem, .odt, .sxw, .stw, .3ds, .max, .3dm, .ods, .sxc, .stc, .dif, .slk, .wb2, .odp, .sxd, .std, .sxm, .sqlite3, .sqlitedb, .sql, .accdb, .mdb, .dbf, .odb, .mdf, .ldf, .cpp, .pas, .asm, .cmd, .bat, .vbs, .sch, .jsp, .php, .asp, .java, .jar, .class, .mp3, .wav, .swf, .fla, .wmv, .mpg, .vob, .mpeg, .asf, .avi, .mov, .mp4, .mkv, .flv, .wma, .mid, .m3u, .m4u, .svg, .psd, .tiff, .tif, .raw, .gif, .png, .bmp, .jpg, .jpeg, .iso, .backup, .zip, .rar, .tgz, .tar, .bak, .ARC, .vmdk, .vdi, .sldm, .sldx, .sti, .sxi, .dwg, .pdf, .wk1, .wks, .rtf, .csv, .txt, .msg, .pst, .ppsx, .ppsm, .pps, .pot, .pptm, .pptx, .ppt, .xltm, .xltx, .xlc, .xlm, .xlt, .xlw, .xlsb, .xlsm, .xlsx, .xls, .dotm, .dot, .docm, .docx, .doc The new extension will be .WNCRY after a file has been encrypted, and WannaCrypt will leave a Please_read_me.txt file and WanaDecryptor.exe in every folder where files have been encrypted. WannaCrypt payment demand screen, complete with Contact Us for technical assistance The Payment Demand After encrypting all the files on the system machine, it will open up a program called Wana Decrypt0r 2.0, which displays instructions on how to pay the ransom fee and recover the files, and offers a helpful FAQ, displayed here. There are three different Bitcoin addresses provided for paying the ransom fee 12t9YDPgwueZ9NyMgw519p7AA8isjr6SMw 115p7UMMngoj1pMvkpHijcRdfJNXj6LrLn 13AM4VW2dhxYgXeQepoHkHSQuy6NgaEb94 Helpful WannaCrypt FAQ Image source   How to Protect Against WannaCrypt Steps for preventing a WannaCrypt and other ransomware infections include Ensure that the MS17-010 security update is installed on all Windows machines within your organization. Security Update for Microsoft Windows SMB Server 4013389. This applies as well to systems for which Microsoft has discontinued support  for this specific attack, they have issued a patch as well for Windows XP, 8, and Server 2003. See also  In line with Microsofts guidance from 2016, disable SMBv1 on all Windows systems. Consider firewalling off access to all file servers, per the recommendation from U.S. CERT in the wake of the release of this exploit by the Shadow Brokers hacking group. Ensure that you have email and web security that can block malicious emails and malware Command  Control server communications. Beware of e-mails containing Office documents, PDFs and JavaScripts or any other suspicious attachments.

    "content": "### Data Security and Protection Guidance\n\n#### **1. Security Best Practices**\n- **Keep Software Updated**: Regularly update your operating system, applications, and firmware. Enable automatic updates if possible.\n- **Use Strong Passwords**: Create complex passwords for all accounts and avoid reusing them across multiple platforms.\n- **Disable Unnecessary Features**: Turn off any features or services you don\u2019t use, such as outdated protocols like SMBv1.\n- **Use Antivirus/Antimalware**: Install and regularly update antivirus software to detect and block malicious activities.\n\n#### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Backup Regularly**: Perform frequent backups of important files and store them in a secure location, such as an external drive or cloud storage. Consider using the 3-2-1 backup rule (3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite).\n- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use encryption for sensitive files and communications to protect them from unauthorized access.\n- **Secure Backup Storage**: Ensure backups are stored offline and cannot be accessed by malicious actors.\n\n#### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Be Cautious with Emails**: Avoid opening suspicious emails, especially those with attachments or links from unknown sources. Verify the sender\u2019s identity before interacting with the content.\n- **Avoid Suspicious Links/Downloads**: Do not click on links or download files from untrusted sources, as they may deliver malware.\n- **Use Antivirus Software**: Ensure your antivirus software is enabled and updated to scan files and emails.\n- **Monitor Network Activity**: Regularly check for unusual network behavior that may indicate a breach.\n\n#### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Unpatched Systems**: Many attacks, like WannaCrypt, exploit known vulnerabilities. Patch systems promptly to reduce risk.\n- **Phishing Attacks**: Educate yourself and others on identifying phishing attempts, which are often the entry point for ransomware.\n- **Malicious Links/Attachments**: Be vigilant with emails containing Office documents, PDFs, or JavaScript files, as they are common ransomware vectors.\n- **Isolate Infected Machines**: If a device is compromised, disconnect it from the network immediately to prevent the spread of malware.\n\n#### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Minimize Data Sharing**: Avoid sharing sensitive information unless necessary, and only through secure channels.\n- **Use Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive communications and data to protect them from interception.\n- **Secure Communication Tools**: Use encrypted communication tools like Signal or WhatsApp for sensitive discussions.\n- **Beware of Public Wi-Fi**: Avoid accessing sensitive accounts or data over public Wi-Fi without using a VPN.\n\n#### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- **Recognize Infection Signs**: If you notice sudden file encryption, ransom demands, or unusual system behavior, seek help immediately.\n- **Do Not Pay Ransom**: Avoid paying the ransom, as it does not guarantee file recovery and may encourage further attacks.\n- **Consult Professionals**: If you suspect an attack or need assistance with security measures, contact a trusted cybersecurity professional.\n- **Report Incidents**: Report ransomware incidents to your organization\u2019s IT department or local authorities.\n\nBy following these practical guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of ransomware and other cyber threats. Remember, vigilance and preparedness are your best defenses against cyberattacks.",
