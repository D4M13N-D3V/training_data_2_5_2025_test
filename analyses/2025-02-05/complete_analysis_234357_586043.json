      "user_guidance": "### Security Guidance for End-Users: Data Security and Protection\n\n#### 1. **Easy-to-Follow Security Best Practices**\n   - **Use Strong Passwords:** Ensure all accounts have unique, complex passwords (e.g., a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols). Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts.\n   - **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to your phone or a biometric scan).\n   - **Keep Software Updated:** Regularly update your operating system, applications, and antivirus software to protect against known vulnerabilities.\n   - **Be Cautious with Emails:** Avoid opening suspicious emails, attachments, or links, especially from unknown senders, as they may contain phishing scams or malware.\n   - **Back Up Data Regularly:** Schedule regular backups of important files to an external drive or cloud storage service to prevent data loss in case of an attack or system failure.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Encrypt Sensitive Data:** Use encryption for sensitive information, such as financial data or personal identifiable information (PII), both in transit (e.g., when sending emails) and at rest (e.g., stored on devices).\n   - **Limit Access to Data:** Restrict access to sensitive data to only those who need it for their work. Use role-based access controls to minimize exposure.\n   - **Secure Devices:** Ensure all devices (laptops, phones, tablets) are protected with passwords, biometric authentication, or encryption.\n   - **Use Secure Communication Tools:** Prefer encrypted messaging apps (e.g., Signal, WhatsApp) for sensitive conversations.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Avoid Suspicious Links and Attachments:** If an email seems unusual or too good (or bad) to be true, do not click on links or open attachments. Verify the sender\u2019s identity first.\n   - **Verify Links Before Clicking:** Hover over links to see the full URL before clicking. Be wary of misspelled or slightly altered URLs.\n   - **Use Public Wi-Fi with Caution:** Avoid accessing sensitive accounts or entering personal information while using public Wi-Fi. Consider using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) for added security.\n   - **Install Antivirus Software:** Use reputable antivirus software and enable real-time scanning to detect and block malware.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Phishing Attacks:** Be vigilant with emails, calls, or messages that ask for personal information or login credentials.
