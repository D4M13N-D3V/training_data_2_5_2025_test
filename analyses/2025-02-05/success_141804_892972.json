CCPA Framework is a FREE data privacy management and compliance plugin for WordPress. Download Privacy Features INclude Do Not Sell my Private Information Capability Enable DSAR On One Page Generate CCPA-Compatible Privacy Policy Templates Installation Wizard for Quick Start Option To Delete or Anonymize Data Automatically Or Manually Track, Manage and Withdraw Consent FAQ Can the plugin manage a users cookie preferences? No. In our current version the popup only records that a user accepts that they know the site uses cookies. The cookie descriptions should be listed in the privacy policy page.

Any number of consent checkboxes can be created and tracked for use with forms, newsletter sign-ups, surveys and more. Can I change the look and feel of the cookie acceptance popup? Yes. The plugin allows for some customization. What is the difference between delete and anonymize my data? Delete will fully remove a user from the database. Anonymize will remove any private information for field setup to be anonymous. Information is removed, but some information in the database remains. Can users download a copy of their private information? Yes. Users can download an HTML or JSON copy of their private information stored on the website. Will the plugin automatically generate a privacy page for me? Yes. The plugin will generate a privacy policy page. To complete the page, a web administrator must complete any policy information unique to the business. These are marked with To-Do.

A record of submissions is available as a custom post type in the administration area of WordPress. Does the plugin offer free support? Yes.
