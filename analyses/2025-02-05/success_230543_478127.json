March 22, 2018 0900 AM Eastern Standard Time SAN FRANCISCO  Resilient Network Systems, the contextual access control company, today announced full support for the FIDO Universal Second Factor U2F authentication standard in Resilient Access. U2F is a standard that dates back to 2011 when Google, Yubico and others, as part of the FIDO Alliance, created an open authentication standard based on public key cryptography. U2F combines the familiar username  password factor with a second factor based on U2F-compliant tokens from vendors such as Yubico, Feitan or Vasco. Adding a hardware authenticator means that even if a password is compromised hackers cannot access your account. Google is now using this technology as the foundation to its Advanced Protection Program , an offering launched in October 2017, that provides Googles strongest security, for those who are at an elevated risk of attack. Before offering U2F to its customers, Google deployed the solution to 50,000 of its own employees. Results included a nearly two-thirds reduction in the time it took to authenticate over Googles previous OTP via SMS approach. Google also experienced a decrease in authentication failures to zero, which was estimated to save thousands of hours per year in cost over the OTP approach. We are pleased to announce this new strong factor as an option for our customers who need the latest in protection against modern phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks, explained Ethan Ayer, CEO of Resilient Network Systems, our engineers were able to take advantage of the very latest Chrome and Firefox high-level javascript APIs so that Resilient could bring U2F in to production. The first customer that has deployed U2F tokens is a healthcare care coordination platform that needed to attain the highest possible level of security compliance for their own administrators. As will be detailed in a case study in Q2, they use the Resilient Access platform to achieve different levels of security for their internal users, partners and patients.
