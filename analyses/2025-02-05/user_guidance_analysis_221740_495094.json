Largely inspired by the General Data Privacy Regulation GDPR, the CCPA is very similar in its quest to move control of consumer data back into the hands of the customer. However, one major difference that business owners must pay close attention to and prepare for is the difference in what is deemed Personal Information that the company will now be responsible for. Personal Information Under CCPA Under the CCPA, the definition of Personal Information that is deemed sensitive is much broader than under GDPR. The following is a summation of the 11 categories the Californian law constitutes as Personal Information Personal Identifiers such as real name, SSN, passport number, etc. Specific information under customer records. Legally bound information such as products or services purchased, consuming histories or tendencies, etc. Biometric information. Internet or other network activity such as browsing history, search history, etc. Geolocation data. Characteristics detected by the senses. Employment-related data. Educational information, as defined in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act 20 U.S.C. section 1232g, 34 C.F.R. Part 99. Inferences obtained from any of the above information used to create a customer profile. Under CCPA, businesses will be responsible for a much wider set of customer Personal Information than under law of GDPR. For example, objective statements, such as a customers credit card number, are regarded as personal information under both CCPA and GDPR and must be handled in full compliancy with the businesses respective governing law. However, subjective statements, such as an insurance brokers driver reliability assessment or an online retailers assessment of their best customers will only be affected under CCPA. In other words, sectors that tend to process a mass amount of subjective information, or information that is not comprised of only one correct answer, will now have to ensure all of this data is compliant under CCPA. Also, it is important to note that under CCPA, Personal Information does now always have to be sensitive . Meaning that a customers IP address and browsing history must be regulated as well. Another key difference between CCPA and GDPR is that the Californian law allows consumers to have a much greater view and overall control of the Personal Information that a business may hold on them. The difficulty in this is that since the definition of Personal Information under CCPA is so broad, the mass amount of data that a business may have on a customer is usually fragmented throughout the organization, leading it to be extremely expensive and time consuming to access, given that the customer exercises their CCPA given rights. The dawn of a new age of consumer privacy rights is upon us  come January 1 st 2020, organizations operating under CCPA will be separated into two categories those who are held back by the law, and those who thrive under it. To fully leverage the indoctrination of CCPA, organizations must have a solution in place to handle the sheer mass amount of Personal Information that they will obtain from their customers, and also a solution that enables the customer to exercise their CCPA given rights  in an cost-efficient, time-efficient, and compliant manner.

  "analysis": "**End-User Guidance on Data Security and Protection Under CCPA**\n\nUnderstanding the Expanded Definition of Personal Information (PI) under CCPA is crucial for effective data security. CCPA broadens the scope of PI, encompassing not just sensitive data like Social Security Numbers but also less obvious information such as IP addresses and browsing history. This guide provides practical recommendations to help you protect your data effectively.\n\n### 1. **Security Best Practices:**\n- **Data Classification:** Regularly categorize data based on sensitivity. Use tools to automate this process, ensuring compliance and focused protection for critical information.\n- **Access Controls:** Restrict data access to only necessary personnel. Implement the principle of least privilege to minimize exposure risks.\n- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA for all accounts, especially those handling PI, to add an extra layer of security beyond passwords.\n\n### 2. **Data Protection Recommendations:**\n- **Encryption:** Use encryption for data both at rest and in transit. This ensures that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable without the decryption key.\n- **Data Minimization:** Collect only the data necessary for your operations. Retain it only as long as needed, reducing the risk of unnecessary exposure.\n- **Incident Response Plan:** Develop a plan to quickly respond to breaches, including containment, assessment, and communication strategies. Regularly test this plan.\n\n### 3. **Safe Usage Guidelines:**\n- **Email Caution:** Be wary of phishing attempts. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or opening unexpected attachments.\n- **Password Management:** Use strong, unique passwords for each account. Consider a password manager to securely store them.\n- **Software Updates:** Regularly update software and devices to protect against vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates where possible.\n\n### 4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention:**\n- **Phishing Attacks:** Educate users on identifying phishing emails. Conduct regular training sessions.\n- **Insider Threats:** Monitor user activity for unusual behavior. Implement alerts for large data transfers or accesses outside normal patterns.\n- **Data Breaches:** Use encryption and access controls to mitigate breach impacts. Have an incident response plan ready for quick action.\n\n### 5. **Privacy Protection Measures:**\n- **Transparency:** Clearly communicate data collection practices to users. Provide easy-to-understand privacy notices.\n- **Consumer Rights:** Implement processes to handle CCPA consumer requests, such as data access or deletion. Ensure these processes are efficient and compliant.\n- **Data Sharing:** Only share data with third parties who can demonstrate CCPA compliance. Document these relationships with contracts.\n\n### 6. **When to Seek Additional Security Support:**\n- **Data Breach Handling:** Consult professionals if a breach occurs to ensure proper containment and legal compliance.\n- **Complex Compliance Needs:** Seek expert help if your organization handles a large volume of diverse data, requiring intricate compliance strategies.\n- **Security Audits:** Engage with security experts to conduct regular audits and identify vulnerabilities before they become issues.\n\n### Conclusion:\nProactive data security under CCPA requires a combination of awareness, practical measures, and sometimes professional support. By understanding the expanded definition of PI, implementing these strategies, and staying informed, you can protect your data effectively. Regular training and updates are key to maintaining a secure environment. Stay vigilant and empower yourself with the knowledge to handle data securely in the evolving digital landscape."
