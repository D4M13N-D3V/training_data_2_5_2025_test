Security Best Practices\n\n- **Use Strong Passwords**: Create unique passwords for each account, combining letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or names.\n\n- **Enable MFA**: Multi-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security. Use it whenever available, especially for banking and email accounts.\n\n- **Be Cautious with Emails**: Do not click on links or download attachments from unfamiliar senders. Legitimate banks will not ask for sensitive information via email.\n\n- **Stay Updated**: Regularly update your software and apps to protect against vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Monitor Accounts**: Check your bank and email accounts frequently for any unauthorized activity.\n\n- **Install Antivirus**: Use reputable antivirus software and ensure it is updated for real-time protection.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Data Protection Tips\n\n- **Secure Sensitive Information**: Avoid sharing personal details like OTPs or passwords via email or SMS.\n\n- **Encrypt Data**: Use encryption for sensitive files, especially when sending them over the internet.\n\n- **Backup Regularly**: Store backups on external drives or encrypted cloud services to prevent data loss.\n\n- **Verify Sources**: Before providing personal information, confirm the authenticity of the request through official channels.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Safe Usage Guidelines\n\n- **Safe Browsing**: Type URLs directly into the browser instead of clicking on links from emails or messages.\n\n- **Recognize Phishing Attempts**: Be wary of emails with urgent requests or grammatical errors. Legitimate institutions usually communicate without such prompts.\n\n- **Avoid Suspicious Downloads**: Only download apps from trusted sources like official app stores.\n\n- **Use Secure Networks**: Avoid accessing sensitive accounts on public Wi-Fi; consider using a VPN.\n\n- **Log Out Properly**: Always log out from your accounts, especially when using public computers.\n\n---\n\n### 4.
