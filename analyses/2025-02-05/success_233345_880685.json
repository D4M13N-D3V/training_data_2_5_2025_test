Join me here every few weeks where Ill share my observations on the latest technology happenings within the Beltway and across Government. Well discuss the latest trends in Identity and Access Management, as well as some of the conferences and meetings I attend in my role as VP of Business Development and Sales at Resilient Network Systems. Back in my college days, I loved the TV show, James Burke Connections and one idea that has stuck with me all of these years is that single eureka innovation moments are very rare, and more common is a slow progression of separate, new capabilities combining to create a leap forward. Nowhere do I see this type of innovation more prevalent than after spending a few decades working with the U.S. Government. A case in point is the cloud. Federal agencies for years now have been on an unwavering trajectory of embracing cloud environments, and why not? Cloud environments offer the ability to spend less on infrastructure and maintenance, while simultaneously enabling a greater mobility of information and resources. Additionally, the cloud offers the financial flexibility of the SaaS model to pay only for the capacity that is actually needed at any given time. Those who have to architect and maintain cloud environments understand that new problems have emerged. Now IT staff has to worry about their datas life-cycle, as opposed to just their servers lifecycle, and the skills for managing a cloud vendor are different than managing hardware. In the end, the clouds full potential can never be completely realized until the issues of trust and fluidity across multiple clouds can be addressed and one way to do that is with better cross boundary network-based policy management with contextual access control. An agencys governing IT policies are a workflow-intensive and politically-sensitive investment of resources to design, approve, implement and monitor. Once this mountain of work is operational, the idea of changing an agencys policies to work with another organization is simply too labor intensive to be seriously considered. However, this is precisely what organizations are faced with since their core mission increasingly requires them to regularly engage with other agencies, foreign partners, commercial entities and private citizens. So agencies find themselves stuck with the mission to reach across boundaries, but their new cloud environments cant accomplish this goal because their policies and access controls are different from everyone elses. No one can easily engage externally, and so the promise of clouds easily interacting with each other and connecting everyone with everything seamlessly remains a pipe dream. In short, the bigger problem solved by cloud still needs a few remaining innovations before clouds full benefits and potential can be completely realized. To date, most organizations have addressed their needs the only way that they can by expending the heavy setup, administrative and maintenance resources to manually add the external users to their environments. Thankfully, the missing pieces to the cloud though are now finally becoming available. Resilients network-based policy management can now facilitate a cloud-to-cloud, across boundary policy connection by negotiating disparate organizational policies through harvesting and interrogating attributes brought from authorities from both sides of the boundary. This approach enables each organization on either side of the boundary to build a sufficient level of trust from the information presented by the other party, in order to authenticate users and systems, and then grant whatever level of access each side wishes to provide. With this new innovation in place, one more giant leap of progression has now been added toward realizing the dream promised by cloud. Now if only we could definitively identify all the devices and users on a cloud. About the author Daemon Price is the VP of Business Development and Sales at Resilient Networks Systems. A Virginia Tech graduate, where he participated in the Corps of Cadets, Daemon held multiple postings within the Dept. of Agriculture and the Dept. of Commerce before taking his information security experience to the private sector where he worked for both small businesses like SoftMed Systems creator of the original electronic health record and Blackboard education IT innovator to prime contractors like CSC, SAIC and 3M. With government awards and billion dollar solicitation wins to his credit, Daemon continues as a passionate technology evangelist and can be seen often at events held by AFCEA, INSA, NDIA, AUSA, FCW and many others.

    "content": "**Comprehensive Analysis of Cybersecurity Content: \"Cross Boundary Policy Management in Cloud Environments\"**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Key Security Features and Their Benefits\n- **Cross-Boundary Policy Management**: Enables seamless collaboration across different cloud environments by negotiating disparate policies, allowing secure and efficient external partnerships.\n- **Contextual Access Control**: Grants access based on dynamic attributes (user role, device, location), enhancing security beyond static policies.\n\n### 2. Compliance Certifications and Regulatory Adherence\n- **Inferred Compliance**: While specific certifications like FedRAMP or FISMA are not mentioned, adherence to these is crucial for government agencies. Resilient's product may hold such certifications, but verification is recommended.\n- **Relevant Regulations**: NIST guidelines, OMB Memoranda, and data lifecycle management standards are important considerations for government compliance.\n\n### 3. User-Focused Security Recommendations\n- **Regular Policy Reviews**: Periodically audit and update access policies to ensure relevance and security.\n- **Automation Adoption**: Use automated tools for policy management to reduce manual workload and potential errors.\n- **Training Personnel**: Ensure IT staff are trained on cloud security and policy management to address new challenges effectively.\n\n### 4. Technical Security Implementation Details\n- **Conceptual Mechanisms**: The blog mentions network-based policy management and contextual access control, likely involving protocols like OAuth or SAML, but specific details are needed for a comprehensive assessment.\n- **Attribute Negotiation**: The system negotiates policies using attributes from both sides of a boundary, facilitating trust and access decisions.\n\n### 5. Data Protection Measures\n- **Encryption**: Essential for data both at rest and in transit, though specifics are not provided in the blog.\n- **Access Controls**: Implement role-based access controls and attribute-based access control to protect sensitive data.\n- **Auditing**: Regular audits ensure data handling compliance and security.\n\n### 6. Best Practices for End Users\n- **Strong Authentication**: Enforce multi-factor authentication to secure user access.\n- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Limit access rights to necessary levels to reduce security risks.\n- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review user access and permissions to maintain security posture.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe blog provides a high-level overview of Resilient's approach to cross-boundary policy management, highlighting key security features and the importance of compliance. However, it lacks specific technical and compliance details. For a comprehensive security assessment, detailed product documentation and certifications should be reviewed. Emphasizing best practices and compliance with federal standards will enhance the security posture for government agencies adopting cloud solutions.",
