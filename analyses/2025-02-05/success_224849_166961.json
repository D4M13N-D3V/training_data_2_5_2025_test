Sales Increases Improve sales margins by adding solution value. Reduce Costs Reduce your customers operational overhead  enabling higher throughput for their systems. Benefits For Your Customers and Overall IP Reputation Lower Resources Second-tier resource requirements are significantly reduced such as, hardware and network. Save Bandwidth and Enhance Performance By blocking 85 of unwanted traffic at the perimeter, bandwidth and resource use can be substantially reduced, which improves the Quality of Service for remaining traffic. Increase Security Filtering traffic from the devices that distribute and host viruses, worms and trojans before they can enter the network increases overall security. Eliminate False Positives When using rate-limits and temporary rejects, a measured response can virtually eliminate false positives. Improve Detection Overall detection rate is improved. How Cyrens IP Reputation Works for Email A partner device will identify an incoming SMTP connection request. The device then queries IP Reputation for information about the sender IP address. Based on these results that come from the GlobalView, the connection is accepted, tempfailed, perm- failed, or throttled.
