      "user_guidance": "### End-User Guidance on Data Security and Protection\n\nProtecting sensitive data is a critical responsibility for everyone. Below are practical, easy-to-follow security best practices and recommendations to help you safeguard your information and maintain privacy.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Data Classification Best Practices**\n   - **Understand Data Sensitivity**: Recognize that not all data is created equal. Classify data based on its sensitivity, such as:\n     - **Public**: Information that can be freely shared (e.g., press releases).\n     - **Internal**: Data intended for use within the organization (e.g., employee directories).\n     - **Confidential**: Sensitive data that requires restricted access (e.g., financial records, customer data, or personal information).\n   - **Label Data Appropriately**: Use clear labels (e.g., \"Confidential\" or \"Internal Only\") to indicate the sensitivity level of documents, emails, or files.\n   - **Limit Access**: Only share classified data with authorized individuals who need it to perform their jobs.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Use Encryption**:\n     - Encrypt sensitive data at rest (stored data) and in transit (data being sent over a network or via email).\n     - Use tools like VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to secure internet connections when accessing sensitive data on public Wi-Fi.\n   - **Secure Storage**:\n     - Store sensitive files in password-protected folders or encrypted drives.\n     - Avoid saving sensitive data on personal devices or unsecured cloud storage.\n   - **Backup Regularly**:\n     - Back up critical data to a secure, encrypted location (e.g., an external hard drive or cloud storage service).\n     - Test backups periodically to ensure data can be restored.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Avoid Unsafe Sharing**:\n     - Never share sensitive data via unsecured methods like email, text, or messaging apps unless absolutely necessary and encrypted.\n     - Use secure file-sharing tools provided by your organization.\n   - **Be Mindful of Public Wi-Fi**:\n     - Avoid accessing or transferring sensitive data when connected to public Wi-Fi. Use a VPN if you must connect.\n   - **Dispose of Data Safely**:\n     - Use secure deletion tools to permanently remove sensitive data from devices.\n     - Shred physical documents containing confidential information before disposal.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Phishing and Social Engineering**:\n     - Be cautious of unsolicited emails, calls, or messages asking for sensitive information.\n     - Verify the identity of the requester before responding or sharing data.\n     - Look for red flags like typos, unusual sender addresses, or urgent language.\n   - **Malware and Ransomware**:\n     - Avoid downloading attachments or clicking links from unknown sources.\n     - Keep antivirus software updated and run regular scans.\n   - **Weak Passwords**:\n     - Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.\n     - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) whenever possible.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Privacy Protection Measures**\n   - **Set Privacy Settings**:\n     - Review and adjust privacy settings on social media, cloud storage, and other online accounts.\n   - **Minimize Data Collection**:\n     - Avoid providing unnecessary personal information on forms, websites, or apps.\n   - **Use Privacy Tools**:\n     - Consider using privacy-focused browsers, email services, or encrypted communication apps.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n   - **Report Suspicious Activity**:\n     - If you suspect a data breach, phishing attempt, or unauthorized access, notify your organization\u2019s IT or security team immediately.\n   - **Ask for Help with**:\n     - Configuring encryption or security tools.\n     - Investigating unusual account activity or errors.\n     -_BOARDING new devices or accounts with sensitive data.\n   - **Professional Assistance**:\n     - Contact a cybersecurity expert if you\u2019re unsure about how to handle sensitive data or secure a system.\n\n---\n\nBy following these practical tips, you can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and protect sensitive information. Remember, data security is everyone\u2019s responsibility\u2014stay vigilant and proactive!"
