How Outbound Spam Protection Works Cyrens email security solutions utilize patented Recurrent Pattern Detection RPD technology. This technology can analyze billions of messages per day  identifying outbreaks the moment they occur. To provide accurate protection from lower volume local or regional outbound spam, a local instance of RPD is deployed with each Outbound Anti-Spam Engine. RPD then analyzes the traffic to provide spam and phishing classifications based on its unique global view of outbreaks. Outbound emails are scanned by the Anti-Spam Outbound engine for global and locally recurring patterns. This helps to identify spam, phishing, and email-borne malware while also tracking each senders traffic statistics, such as mails per time period. Once a sender crosses a threshold, a notification is then sent along with the sender address. Samples of the blocked emails are then provided for analysis during the remediation process.
