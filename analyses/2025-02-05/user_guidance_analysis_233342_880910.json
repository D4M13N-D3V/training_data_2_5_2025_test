What was the yearly salary of your last position? What is your Social Security national insurance number? Consider how many PII personally identifiable information questions your organization asks for background checks of individuals being vetted as a candidate for a new position. These questions increase dramatically after the candidate is selected. How many of these questions are PII-related? PII is any information used to distinguish one person or another. Entering ones name, bank account, address or telephone number are necessary tasks to interact with businesses. However, each entry increases the risk of exposing this information to the wrong person. In May 2018, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation GDPR takes effect. The first comprehensive attempt at establishing data compliance standards across national economies, GDPR establishes timelines to notify users of data breaches and penalties for non-compliance. The regulation also details specific rights for citizens to access their own data and understand why its being collected, processed, and stored. The Four Pillars of Data Subject Rights GDPR mandates organizations design and implement data protection into their systems and processes. They must be able to identify and secure this information across the data lifecycle from collection and processing to analyzing and storage. Organizations will now be held responsible and accountable by policies that protect your PII rights across four pillars Right to Access Who has my information and what is it being used for? Individuals have the right to know which PII is being collected and processed, where it is stored, and why the organization needs it. Right to Be Forgotten Why are you processing my information when I am not associated with your organization? Individuals have the right to cease the processing and dissemination of their data. They also have the right to have their data deleted from an organizations system. Right to Data Portability Why do I have to answer the same PII questions multiple times? The public has the right to retain and reuse data across different applications and services. Organizational data networks must comply with portability and security standards to safely transfer PII within and across systems. Right to Breach Notification How will I know if my information is compromised? When data is compromised, individuals have the right to be notified of the breach. Businesses are required to report breaches to authorities within 72 hours, and individuals will be notified as soon as possible thereafter. How Can FileFacets Help?

Below are practical, easy-to-follow recommendations to help you protect your data and stay compliant with privacy standards.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Easy-to-Follow Security Best Practices**\n- **Minimize Data Collection**: Only collect and store the PII that is absolutely necessary for your operations. Avoid unnecessary collection of sensitive information like Social Security numbers, addresses, or bank details unless required.\n- **Use Strong Passwords**: Create complex passwords (e.g., a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols) and avoid reusing them across accounts. Consider using a password manager to securely store your credentials.\n- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to your phone or a fingerprint) when accessing sensitive systems or accounts.\n- **Regularly Update Software**: Keep your operating systems, applications, and tools up to date to protect against vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use encryption to protect PII when it is being transmitted or stored. This ensures that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be read without the decryption key.\n- **Implement Access Controls**: Restrict access to PII to only those who need it for legitimate purposes. Use role-based access controls to limit unnecessary exposure.\n- **Conduct Regular Audits**: Periodically review the data you collect, store, and process to ensure compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations. Remove any unnecessary or outdated PII.\n- **Backup Data Securely**: Regularly back up critical data and store it securely, both physically and digitally. Use encrypted storage solutions for backups.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Transactions**: Public Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured, making it easy for hackers to intercept your data. Avoid accessing sensitive accounts or entering PII on public networks.\n- **Be Cautious with Phishing Attempts**: Never click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders. Verify the source of emails or messages before taking any action.\n- **Educate Yourself and Others**: Stay informed about data protection best practices and share this knowledge with colleagues and team members to create a culture of security.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Phishing Attacks**: Scammers often pretend to be legitimate organizations to steal your PII. Be vigilant and verify the authenticity of requests before responding.\n  - **Prevention**: Use email filtering tools, enable anti-phishing features in your browser, and educate users on how to spot phishing attempts.\n- **Insider Threats**: Employees or contractors with access to PII may intentionally or unintentionally cause breaches.\n  - **Prevention**: Implement strict access controls, monitor user activity, and provide regular security training.\n- **Lost or Stolen Devices**: Unsecured laptops, smartphones, or USB drives can lead to data breaches.\n  - **Prevention**: Encrypt devices, enable remote wiping, and use strong passwords or biometric authentication.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Understand Data Subject Rights**: Familiarize yourself with GDPR's \"Four Pillars of Data Subject Rights\":\n  1. **Right to Access**: Individuals can request details about how their PII is collected, processed, and stored.\n  2. **Right to Be Forgotten**: Individuals can request the deletion of their PII under certain conditions.\n  3. **Right to Data Portability**: Individuals can request their data to be transferred to another service provider.\n  4. **Right to Breach Notification**: Organizations must notify individuals if their PII has been compromised in a breach.\n- **Collect Data with Consent**: Ensure that you have explicit consent before collecting and processing PII. Provide clear privacy notices explaining how the data will be used.\n- **Adopt Privacy by Design**: Build privacy into your processes and systems from the outset. Use tools like FileFacets to identify, classify, and manage PII effectively.\n\n---\n\n### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- **Suspected Breach**: If you suspect a data breach or unauthorized access to PII, contact your organization's IT or security team immediately.\n- **Compliance Concerns**: If you are unsure about GDPR compliance or data protection requirements, consult with a data protection officer (DPO) or legal advisor.\n- **Advanced Threats**: If you encounter sophisticated threats like ransomware, malware, or large-scale phishing campaigns, seek assistance from cybersecurity professionals.\n- **Training Needs**: If you or your team lacks knowledge on data security best practices, request training sessions from your organization or a trusted third-party provider.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nProtecting PII and complying with regulations like GDPR requires proactive measures and a commitment to security. By following these practical recommendations, you can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and ensure the privacy of individuals. Always stay vigilant, educate yourself and others, and seek support when needed."
