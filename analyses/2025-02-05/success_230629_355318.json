GDPR requires organizations that collect, process, and store personal data  any personal data at all for any reason  to design and employ processes that protect data from either falling into the wrong hands or being misused by organizations who request it.Chapter 3 of GDPR protects individuals by setting forth specific rights regarding the acquisition, use, and storage of their personal information.
