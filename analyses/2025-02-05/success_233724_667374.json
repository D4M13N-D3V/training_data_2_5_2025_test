September 6, 2016 Movie and TV watchers who download pirated content have long been warned of the potential for malware that might accompany their chosen media. Now use is again being made of Digital Rights Management DRM functionality  designed to prevent piracy  to distribute malware. The new attack, brought to Cyrens attention by security researcher Amitay Dan, abuses a DRM popup message function that is built into Windows Media Player. In normal legitimate operation the feature works like this A content provider embeds an authorization URL in their DRM protected content that will be displayed in the Media Player window, to allow the user to acquire a license to play the content A content user opens the legitimately downloaded content in Media Player Media Player pops up a message You do not have rights to play this file along with the authorization URL and a security warning. The user needs to click on OK to open a window to the authorization URL, so that the user can enter credentials or pay to acquire the content The content owner authorizes the content and the content user can now watchlisten to the legitimate content The abuse of this DRM link functionality was first reported over 10 years ago and it resurfaces every few years  but it appears that the threat is little known and is now being used once again. The malware version goes like this User downloads infected media  in this case War-Dogs-2016-720p-BrRip-x264-SiNNERS. In this case the media was downloaded using BitTorrent  but could come from any download source. When the .wmv file is opened in Media Player the DRM warning message pops up listing the URL of the malware distributors Clicking on Yes opens up a similar small window, this time showing content created by the malware distributors with the message given verbatim here, As this video is built in advanced 2016 .Xvid codec you might face difficulties playing the video without latest codecs. But for the quality of the Video the .Xvid codecs are essential. So If You want to play the video, Please download the Codec and after installing that you will be able to play almost all the video and audio files available till date. As shown, the window for xvidcodecrepair.com includes a prominent Download Now button. Clicking on Download Now results in download of an executable file codecfix.exe. Codecfix.exe is detected by Cyren as dropperdownloader malware. In addition to installing the dropper, the process also retrieves the latest Divx install  from the legitimate Divx servers  and starts a real Divx install, apparently to give the victim the impression that an actual codec is being installed.
