How Do I Map Personal Information in My Business for CCPA? To comply with the CCPAs definition of Personal Information , businesses must build a full map of all customer data. Any information that can be used to draw inferences about a customer is covered by the law. So businesses are responsible for drastically broadening their view and control of consumer data.
