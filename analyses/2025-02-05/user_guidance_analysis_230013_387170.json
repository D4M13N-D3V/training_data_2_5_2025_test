The survey, which was concluded in September, focuses on the current web and email security status and priorities of IT and security managers at organizations with 100 to 5,000 employees. The survey results allow security personnel to benchmark their own security posture and planning against their peers, including data on the priority placed on different email and web security features, what capabilities organizations have deployed, and how successfullyor unsuccessfullytheir current security is performing across different threat types. Phishing emails and successful attacks a rising tide Nearly half of respondents to the survey said that more mass phishing and spear-phishing emails are getting through their security and reaching users inboxes, with an estimated increase during the past 12 months of 23 for general phishing and 25 for spearphishing. This increase in phishing emails reaching users appears to be having serious consequences44 or organizations said that they suffered a successful phishing attack in the past year, up from 30 in the 2017 survey. And not just one attackrespondents said that they suffered an average of 11.7 successful phishing attacks during the period. Not surprisingly, phishing was ranked as the second-highest threat concern by the managers surveyed, with ransomware retaining its position from 2017 as the threat type of greatest concern. Security spending up for half Forty-nine percent of organizations reported that their IT security budgets grew a robust 18 over the prior year, essentially matching the 17 increase reported in 2017. No organization surveyed reported a decrease in their security budget. The combination of poorer security performance and increased spending appears to be feeding an interest in new solutions, with two-thirds of respondents indicating an extremely strong interest in deploying specialized new services capable of improving phishing and ransomware protection, as well as providing improved sandboxing protection from increasingly evasive threats. Figure 1 Other malware infections were the top source of breaches, with phishing in second. Preference for cloud-based SaaS surpassed on-premises in 2018 The preference in terms of deployment model for security solutions was nearly equally divided in 2017, but the momentum has clearly shifted towards cloud-based security, with 42 of respondents preferring SaaS security, up from 29 in 2017 and 21 in 2016. Twenty-eight percent said they preferred on-premises solutions this year. Figure 2 Preference for cloud-delivered security has surpassed on-premises appliances. Other conclusions from the survey data which are covered in the report include Nearly two-thirds have an email security layer in the cloud Sixty-two percent of businesses rely on SaaS security for their email, up from 57 a year ago, considering together those who reported using a third-party SaaS secure email gateway 35 percent, compared to 28 percent in 2017 and those who have contracted an advanced security module from their hosted email service provider 27 percent. Cloud-based web security is moving up the adoption curve Thirty-seven percent reported that they subscribe to SaaS web security, up from 34 percent in 2017. Security effectiveness and speed of defenses are most desired capabilities The misgivings around security performance were also apparent in the rankings of desired capabilities in new security solutions. Security effectiveness 82 indicating highest importance and speed of defenses applied to new threats 72 were given significantly more weight by managers than cost and other considerations like visibility and reporting features.

  "analysis": "### Practical Security Guidance for End-Users\n\n#### 1. **Security Best Practices**\n   - **Use Strong Passwords**: Ensure passwords are at least 12 characters long, include a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoid using the same password across multiple accounts. Consider using a password manager.\n   - **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Whenever possible, enable MFA for an additional layer of security.\n   - **Keep Software Updated**: Regularly update operating systems, browsers, and applications to protect against vulnerabilities.\n   - **Back Up Data**: Perform regular backups of important data and store them securely, both locally and in the cloud.\n\n#### 2. **Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use encryption for sensitive data, both in transit (e.g., HTTPS) and at rest (e.g., encrypted files or databases).\n   - **Secure Data Sharing**: Only share data via secure channels (e.g., encrypted email or secure file-sharing services) and avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions.\n   - **Implement Access Controls**: Restrict access to data based on the principle of least privilege\u2014only allow access to those who need it.\n   - **Use Cloud-Based Security Solutions**: Consider cloud-based security services for email and web security, as they often provide up-to-date protection and scalability.\n\n#### 3. **Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Be Cautious with Emails**: Avoid opening suspicious emails, clicking on links, or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Verify the sender before taking any action.\n   - **Use Antivirus Software**: Install and regularly update antivirus software to protect against malware.\n   - **Verify Website Legitimacy**: Before entering personal or financial information, ensure the website is legitimate and uses HTTPS.\n   - **Use a VPN**: When using public Wi-Fi, use a reputable VPN to encrypt your internet traffic.\n\n#### 4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Phishing Attacks**: Be vigilant for phishing attempts, which often mimic legitimate communications. Look for spelling mistakes, unfamiliar senders, or urgent requests for sensitive information.\n   - **Malware Infections**: Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources. Use antivirus software and enable real-time scanning.\n   - **Ransomware**: Regularly back up critical data and ensure backups are stored offline or in a secure cloud service.\n   - **Insider Threats**: Monitor user activity and implement access controls to prevent unauthorized data access or theft.\n\n#### 5. **Privacy Protection Measures**\n   - **Limit Personal Data Sharing**: Only share personal information when necessary and verify the recipient\u2019s legitimacy.\n   - **Use Privacy Tools**: Utilize privacy-focused tools like encrypted messaging apps (e.g., Signal) and browsers (e.g., Tor).\n   - **Review Privacy Policies**: Understand how companies use your data and adjust settings to minimize data sharing.\n   - **GDPR Compliance**: If applicable, ensure your organization complies with GDPR regulations to protect user data.\n\n#### 6. **When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n   - **After a Security Incident**: If you suspect a breach or successful attack, contact a security professional immediately to assess and mitigate the damage.\n   - **When Evaluating Security Tools**: Engage with security experts to help select and implement the right solutions for your organization.\n   - **For Advanced Threats**: If your organization faces sophisticated threats (e.g., targeted phishing or ransomware attacks), consider hiring a security consultant or managed security service provider.\n   - **For Developing Security Policies**: Work with security experts to create and enforce robust security policies, especially if your organization lacks in-house expertise.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches and protect your data effectively. Stay informed about emerging threats and adapt your security practices accordingly."
