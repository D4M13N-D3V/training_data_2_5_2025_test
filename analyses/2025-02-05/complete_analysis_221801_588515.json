Dont worry, the attack was successfully remediated before it could impact our customer. The organizations users received a notification about a newly arrived secure message, complete with an expiration date to create a sense of urgency to review the content. To view the secure message, the potential victim had to click on the Open Message button. Once the button is clicked, the user would be immediately redirected to the next stage of phishing attack and continued along this fraud journey. Figure 1  Secure phishing message The button was used to hide the hyperlink to the phishing landing page, but the tricks dont end there.

Once a user entered his or her email address and password, and clicked the Sign In button, the data would go right to the fraudsters hands.
