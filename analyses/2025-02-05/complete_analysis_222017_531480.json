      "user_guidance": "**Data Security Guidance for Survey Forms and Account Protection**\n\n1. **Exercise Caution with Surveys:**\n   - Be wary of surveys received via email, text, or websites. Verify the source by checking the organization's logo and ensuring the URL is legitimate. Hover over links to see the actual destination without clicking.\n\n2. **Avoid Sensitive Information:**\n   - Refrain from entering sensitive details like passwords, financial information, or Social Security numbers in surveys. Legitimate surveys typically don't require such data.\n\n3. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**\n   - Activate 2FA on accounts to add an extra security layer. This can prevent account takeover even if a password is compromised.\n\n4. **Verify Through Alternative Channels:**\n   - If a survey seems suspicious, contact the organization directly using a trusted method, such as a phone number from their official website, to confirm legitimacy.\n\n5. **Identify Red Flags:**\n   - Watch for misspellings, unusual URLs, and unsolicited offers. Avoid using autofill to prevent unintentional disclosure of information.\n\n6. **Be Skeptical of Incentives:**\n   - Surveys offering significant prizes may be phishing attempts. Trust your instincts and avoid participating if unsure.\n\n7. **Use Security Tools:**\n   - Install reputable antivirus and anti-phishing software to detect and block malicious links or attachments.\n\n8. **Educate Yourself on Phishing:**\n   - Recognize phishing tactics, including fake surveys. Stay informed about common strategies used by scammers.\n\n9. **Report Suspicious Surveys:**\n   - Inform the organization or relevant security platforms if you encounter a fake survey. This helps protect others from similar threats.\n\n10. **Stay Informed:**\n    - Regularly update your knowledge on the latest threats by subscribing to security newsletters or following reputable sources.\n\n11. **Act Promptly in Case of Compromise:**\n    - If you suspect an account has been compromised, immediately change passwords, enable 2FA, and contact customer support.\n\nBy following these practical steps, you can enhance your data security and protect against account takeover attacks. Stay vigilant and proactive in safeguarding your information."
