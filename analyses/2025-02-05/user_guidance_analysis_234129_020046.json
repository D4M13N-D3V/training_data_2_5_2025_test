And if you want to get up to speed quickly and try to make sense of all that news, I recommend downloading our new special report on malware , with a special nod to the included interview of anti-virus pioneer Fridrik Skulason, Cyrens VP of Anti-Malware Technologies, who discusses the past, present, and future of malware from the perspective of 30 years experience in fighting cybercrime. There is an excellent glossary of malware types, such as spyware and trojans, at the beginning of the report, followed by a summarized history of malware to provide context for todays events, providing a long view which complements the interview. The reports other several articles explore the May and June mass-scale, global ransomware attacks the explosion of hyper-evasive malware, designed to evade conventional sandbox detection best practices for stopping malware and how criminals are using encrypted SSL connections to hide malware, sharing the results of a study showing that almost 40 of all web malware today utilizes HTTPSyet recent surveys show that the majority of companies around the globe are not inspecting that traffic. Cybercriminals are All in Possibly no time period since the advent of the Internet has experienced as many dramatic global incidents directly related to malware and cyberthreats as the last 12 months. From election hacks to global ransomware attacks, malware threats are at an all-time high. And, unfortunately, as long as it proves lucrative, the only certainty is it will only get worse. Today, no item or user connected to the Internet is immune to attack. While many businesses are still studying what security measures might be necessary, cybercriminals are all in, creating dangerous new tools to target companies, governments, and private citizens. We need to be mindful that the world has changed. Hyper-evasive malware and threat distribution via HTTPS are growing rapidly mobile devices both Android and Appleare increasingly targets and Internet of Things tools, from refrigerators to televisions, are an inviting new vector for criminal purposes. A Three-Front War In this cyber-war, with respect specifically to malware, three current battlefronts stand out ransomware, hyper-evasive malware, and malware distribution via HTTPS. Clearly cybercriminals know the weak points in standard corporate defenses, and theyre optimizing their attacks to leverage security gaps related to these three threats in every possible way. One of the reasons that Cyren produces reports like this is to help businesses better understand the nature of the risks they are facing. In the past 25 years, malware has transformed from a mere nuisance into something that has the power to shut down hospital systems, steal millions from bank accounts, and significantly affect the well-being of businesses and people worldwide. We hope you find the report informative, and that it contributes to a better understanding of the problems faced, and the solutions required.

Security Best Practices**\n   - **Keep Software Updated:** Regularly update your operating system, applications, and antivirus software to protect against vulnerabilities.\n   - **Use Strong Passwords:** Create unique, complex passwords for all accounts and use a password manager to keep track of them.\n   - **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification.\n   - **Back Up Data Frequently:** Regularly back up important files to an external drive or cloud storage to ensure data recovery in case of an attack.\n   - **Practice Safe Computing:** Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.\n\n#### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Encrypt Sensitive Data:** Use encryption for sensitive data both at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access.\n   - **Implement Access Controls:** Limit access to sensitive data to only those who need it, using role-based access controls.\n   - **Inspect Encrypted Traffic:** Use security tools to inspect HTTPS traffic, as nearly 40% of web malware is hidden within encrypted connections.\n   - **Secure IoT Devices:** Change default passwords on IoT devices and keep their firmware updated.\n\n#### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Spot Phishing Attempts:** Be cautious of emails, messages, or calls asking for personal information or login credentials. Verify the source before responding.\n   - **Avoid Unsafe Websites:** Refrain from visiting websites with questionable content, as they may host malware.\n   - **Use Secure Networks:** Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a VPN.\n\n#### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Ransomware:** Prevent ransomware attacks by avoiding suspicious downloads and ensuring regular backups. Use antivirus software with anti-ransomware features.\n   - **Hyper-Evasive Malware:** Protect against evasive malware by using advanced detection tools, such as behavior-based antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.\n   - **Malware in Encrypted Traffic:** Inspect encrypted traffic to detect and block hidden malware.\n\n#### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n   - **Use Privacy Tools:** Employ a VPN when browsing public Wi-Fi and use privacy-focused browsers to minimize tracking.\n   - **Limit App Permissions:** Only grant necessary permissions to apps on your devices to protect your data.\n   - **Secure Communication:** Use end-to-end encrypted messaging apps for sensitive conversations.\n\n#### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n   - **After a Security Incident:** If you suspect you\u2019ve been hacked or compromised, seek professional help immediately to contain the damage and recover data.\n   - **For Advanced Threats:** If you discover sophisticated malware or ransomware, consult with a security expert to ensure proper removal and protection.\n   - **For System Hardening:** If you manage sensitive data or systems, consider hiring a security professional to implement robust protections.\n\nBy following these guidelines, users can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to cyber threats and protect their data effectively. Stay vigilant and proactive in the face of evolving cyber threats!"
