      "user_guidance": "Here are some clear, easy-to-follow security best practices and recommendations for end users:\n\n1. Use strong, unique passwords for each account. Enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible for an extra layer of protection. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely.\n\n2. Be very cautious about opening email attachments or clicking links, even if they appear to come from a known sender. Phishing emails are a common way for attackers to trick you into revealing credentials or installing malware. When in doubt, contact the sender directly to verify before opening.\n\n3. Regularly update your operating system, antivirus/anti-malware software, and other apps to patch security vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates where you can.\n\n4. Avoid using unknown USB drives or charging cables, as they could be used to inject malware. Only connect devices you trust.\n\n5. Back up important data regularly to an external drive or cloud service. This protects you in case of device failure, theft, or ransomware. \n\n6. Be mindful of what you post publicly on social media. Revealing too much personal information online could enable attackers to target you, guess security questions, or impersonate you.\n\n7. When browsing the web, look for \"https\" and the lock icon in the address bar to ensure the site is using encryption. Avoid entering sensitive info on non-secure sites.\n\n8. Consider encrypting sensitive files on your computer, external drives, and in the cloud for added protection in case of loss or theft. Built-in tools like BitLocker (Windows) or FileVault (Mac) make this easy.\n\n9. Securely wipe or destroy old computers and drives before disposal to ensure data isn't recoverable.\n\n10. If you suspect a security incident or discover your accounts have been hacked, immediately change passwords, report to the service provider, and seek help from IT/security if needed. Time is critical.\n\nThe key is being proactive, staying vigilant about risks, and taking basic precautions consistently. For specific security concerns, always consult your IT security team for guidance. User awareness goes a long way in preventing incidents."
