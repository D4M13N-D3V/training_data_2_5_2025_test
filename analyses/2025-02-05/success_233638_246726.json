This week lets discuss the concept of context. Here at Resilient we believe that fundamentally the more information an organization has about an access request the more likely it is to make the correct access decision. Context is a term that describes the sum of all information we can gather about an access request. Its closely related to the concept of Attribute-based Access Control ABAC that we discussed in last weeks blog see IAM Concept of the Week RBAC vs. ABAC . There we defined attributes as pieces of information that act as building blocks to describe relationships between users, actions and resources. With enough information or attributes we can understand the context of any access request. Attributes are broken down into four categories Subject Role, department, company, certifications, biometrics etc. Action Read, write, edit, download etc. Resource Apps, docs, files, APIs, services etc. Environment Time, location, device type, threat level etc. Organizations need to discover and gather these attributes in order to evaluate them against their access policies. The challenge however is that much of this information no longer resides solely within internal databases, such as Active Directory, but instead is dispersed across external databases. In a future post well discuss the importance of a network-based approach to understanding context. Next week well talk more about the interplay between attributes and policy engines.

    "content": "### Security Guidance Based on Context in IAM\n\nUnderstanding and leveraging \"context\" is crucial in Identity and Access Management (IAM) to make informed decisions about access requests. Context refers to the collection of information (attributes) that describe the \"who, what, when, where, and why\" of an access request. Below are practical security recommendations to enhance data security and protection:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Implement Context-Aware Security Practices**\n- Use **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** to verify user identity. This adds an additional layer of security beyond just a password, ensuring that even if credentials are compromised, access isn't granted without the second factor.\n- Enforce **role-based access control (RBAC)** to restrict access to sensitive resources based on a user's role within the organization. This ensures that users only have access to what they need to perform their job functions.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Protect Against Unauthorized Access**\n- Use **attribute-based access control (ABAC)** to evaluate access requests based on user attributes (e.g., role, department), resource attributes (e.g., sensitivity level), and environmental attributes (e.g., time of day, location).\n- Monitor and analyze **environmental attributes** like time, location, and device type. For example, restrict access to critical systems during unusual hours or from unknown locations.\n- Use **geofencing** to limit access to sensitive resources only within approved geographic locations.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Safeguard Data with Classification**\n- **Classify data** based on sensitivity and importance. Use tools like data loss prevention (DLP) to categorize and protect sensitive information (e.g., financial data, personal identifiable information).\n- Apply **context-aware data protection** policies, such as encryption, access controls, and monitoring, to ensure that data is protected both in transit and at rest.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Monitor and Respond to Threats**\n- Implement **real-time monitoring** of access requests and system activity. Use analytics and machine learning to detect anomalies, such as multiple failed login attempts or unusual access patterns.\n- Continuously audit and log access events. Regularly review logs to identify and address potential security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Educate Users on Safe Practices**\n- Train employees on **security best practices**, such as recognizing phishing attempts, using strong passwords, and avoiding the use of public Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks.\n- Use **context-based training** to educate users about the risks associated with accessing sensitive data in certain environments (e.g., public places or shared devices).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Mitigate Risks from External Threats**\n- Use **context-aware security tools** to analyze user behavior and detect potential threats. For example, if a user logs in from an unusual location or attempts to access a sensitive resource outside of normal working hours, the system can flag the activity for review.\n- Implement **threat intelligence** to stay informed about emerging threats and vulnerabilities. Use this information to update access policies and strengthen security controls.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Protect Privacy in Access Decisions**\n- Ensure that access decisions respect user privacy. Only collect and analyze attributes that are necessary for making a security decision.\n- Use **anonymization or pseudonymization** techniques to protect user identities when possible, especially when analyzing access logs or monitoring user activity.\n\n---\n\n### **8. Regularly Review and Update Policies**\n- Periodically review and update access policies to reflect changing business needs and security threats. Ensure that policies are aligned with the organization\u2019s compliance and regulatory requirements.\n- Use **policy engines** to automate the evaluation of access requests based on contextual attributes. Regularly test and refine these policies to ensure they are effective.\n\n---\n\n### **9. Seek Additional Security Support When Needed**\n- If your organization lacks the expertise or resources to implement context-aware security practices, consider engaging with **security consultants** or **managed security service providers (MSSPs)**.\n- Use **cloud-based IAM solutions** that offer built-in context-aware security features, such as automated threat detection and behavioral analysis.\n\n---\n\nBy implementing these practical security recommendations, organizations can enhance their ability to make informed access decisions, protect sensitive data, and reduce the risk of security breaches.",
