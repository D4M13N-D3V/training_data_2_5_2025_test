Most likely a lot, its so easy for users to forget this important instruction when our email inboxes are busier than ever. As the number of sent and received emails has increased to around 300 billion in 2020 so have the number of opportunities for scammers. Business email compromise BEC is an attempt to impersonate someone to illegally take over the victims finances. A BEC attack excludes phishing URLs and malicious files in the attachment. This specific attack is based on social engineering skills, making it hard for the security engines to detect the email once it arrives into the victims mailbox. Usually, BEC is a small-scale attack, which implies a clearly targeted victim. As a general rule, attackers target the person which deals with or indirectly relates to the organizations finances, or has access to corporate banking accounts, etc. It is easy to understand that such an attack requires careful preparation. The criminal must have detailed knowledge of the recipient and the impersonated sender  the trust relationships, their habits and personal qualities. The scammers need strong social engineering skills to be. Low Volume, High Impact According to Cyren Inbox Security statistics, the average percentage of BEC emails is around 2 out of total malicious emails. This does not seem like an astronomical amount, however, we should remember that such an attack is specifically targeted with the main purpose of tricking the victim to submit a money transfer, and it can accumulate to billions of dollars. In comparison with other types of cybercrimes, BEC is considered the most expensive attack. There are a few well known techniques to trick an employee to send money into the scammers pocket. Usually, an impostor tries to impersonate someone from inside the company and pretends to be an internal employee, or trusted vendorbusiness partner. To make fake emails look more realistic, impostors usually use newly created short-lived email addresses. Often the email address itself has nothing to do with the impersonated person. In such a case the scammer might use the name, email address, or corporate domain of the impersonated person to mislead the victim. It is especially effective when the senders address is hidden, and only the name is displayed on the recipient side, as if often the case when reading email on a mobile device. Gmail as the Primary Free Webmail Provider Used by BEC Actors The cheapest and the most affordable way to deliver business email compromise attacks is using free webmail providers. According to 4th Quarter 2020 Phishing Activity Trends Report from APWG, around 75 of the BEC attacks were sent from free webmail providers. Gmail is the preferred service of BEC threat actors.
