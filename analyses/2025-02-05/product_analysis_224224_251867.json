Its native security has a 16 false negative rate for spam and phishing emails, according to Mimecast.

Meanwhile phishing sites can have short life spans, even just a few hours. Analyzing each site in real time is a far stronger form of prevention. And Microsoft 365 has features such as Safe Attachments , which uses virtual sandboxing to scan attachments in an email.
