Related Security Awareness Training Wont Give CISOs or Employees Peace of Mind SEGs are not enough Despite investing a record 3B in Secure Email Gateways SEGs in 2019, US companies still lost 1.7B to phishing . Thats because SEGs scan incoming messages once, by referencing a database of known threats. Many SEGS, such as Microsoft Defender, have a feature called Microsoft Safe Links , which adds add time-of-Click Protection URL re-writing. This gives users a second chance to catch phishing threats as they click links in message bodies. This measure still relies on databases of known threats and attackers easily defeat it by simply putting the URLs in attachments or other basic evasion technique. Meanwhile Spear phishing and Business Email Compromise BEC attacks dont contain URLs or attachments , so they appear harmless to the SEG. Cousin domains are used to obfuscate URLs. Attackers serve up local versions of a spoofed site, so the domain looks legitimate. Trustworthy form-builder services like Microsoft forms, Google forms, Typeform , 123formbuilder and Native forms are leveraged. And attackers are constantly iterating and launching new threats. Once the tainted email has evaded the SEG, the user is your only line of defense.

Avoid reusing passwords across accounts.\n   - **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification for logins.\n   - **Use Encryption:** Protect sensitive data with encryption, especially when sending emails or storing files.\n\n2. **Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Backup Regularly:** Schedule regular backups of important data, both on-site and off-site (e.g., cloud storage).\n   - **Use Encryption for Data:** Encrypt sensitive files and emails to ensure they remain confidential.\n   - **Secure Sharing:** Use secure methods to share files, such as encrypted links or password-protected documents.\n   - **Access Controls:** Limit access to data to only those who need it, using the principle of least privilege.\n\n3. **Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Be Email Cautious:** Check sender details, hover over links before clicking, and avoid opening unexpected attachments.\n   - **Avoid Suspicious Links/Attachments:** Do not click on links or open attachments from unfamiliar sources.\n   - **Use Security Plugins:** Install and regularly update security tools like antivirus and anti-malware.\n   - **Verify Transactions:** Confirm the authenticity of financial transactions through a separate communication channel.\n   - **Report Suspicious Activity:** Inform your IT department immediately if you encounter suspicious emails or activity.\n\n4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Phishing Attacks:** Be vigilant for emails.FormStartPositionI see you've started to outline a structured approach, but let me assist in completing the thought and organizing the information cohesively.\n\n**Common Security Risks and Prevention (Continued)**\n   - **Phishing Attacks:** Recognize attempts to deceive you into providing personal information. Look for spelling/grammar errors, urgent requests, and generic greetings.\n   - **Ransomware:** Prevent infection by avoiding suspicious downloads and ensuring backups are in place.\n   - **Spear Phishing/BEC:** Verify requests from executives or known contacts through alternative means, as these emails may impersonate them.\n   - **Cousin Domains:** Be wary of domains that are similar to but not exactly the same as legitimate ones (e.g., \"paypaI.com\" instead of \"paypal.com\").\n\n5. **Privacy Protection Measures**\n   - **Use VPNs:** Protect your internet traffic, especially on public Wi-Fi, with a Virtual Private Network.\n   - **Secure Communication:** Use encrypted messaging apps for sensitive conversations.\n   - **Guard Personal Information:** Avoid oversharing personal details on social media and be cautious of online forms.\n\n6. **When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n   - **After a Breach:** If your account or data is compromised, contact IT or security experts immediately.\n   - **Suspicious Activity:** Report any unusual emails, pop-ups, or network behavior to your IT department.\n   - **Training Needs:** Request security awareness training to stay informed about the latest threats and best practices.\n\nBy following these guidelines, users can enhance their security posture and contribute to a safer digital environment. Regular training and staying informed are crucial in the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.",
