Our labs have been researching for some time different technologies to help organizations approach the ultimate in data classification  classifying all data sets automatically and completely accurately, stated, President Jason Remillard. By releasing our self-learning system  guided and trained by the data users themselves  coupled with our grid-computing style rapid classification platform  we are one step closer to reaching that goal. ClassiDocs is a leading Data Classification platform that enables End Users and Data Stewards to actively participate in the process of classifying data sets  in an user-friendly, efficient and quick process that generally requires little to no end user training or education. We have performed modelling and testing with the new technology and find that after 500-1,000 manual classifications  the system is able to very accurately assign classifications ongoing. This represents not only an excellent trained and organization specific classification platform  it also enhances the ability for organizations to manage their data classifications with growing accuracy, continues Remillard. The ability to classify data sets in myriad platforms  with an accurate and up-to-date classification system  is integral for any organization health care, financial services, manufacturing, government with private, customer or financial information to protect. ClassiDocs represents a departure from the regular approaches  with its focus on end-user adoption, simple and rapidly deployable architecture and native integrations with leading SIEM, EndPoint Security and Governance and Compliance toolsets.
