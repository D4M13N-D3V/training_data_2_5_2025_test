The decrease in revenue in the second quarter was primarily due to our ongoing shift for some products from one-time sales perpetual licenses with annual maintenance contracts to time-based subscriptions with multiyear upfront payments this shift resulted in fewer customers paying for subscriptions or renewals in the quarter. General and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, were 1,579,529, compared to 1,065,619 for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, an increase of 48. The increase in general and administrative expense primarily consisted of management costs, costs to integrate assets we acquired and to expand sales, product enhancements, audit and review fees, filing fees, professional fees, and other expenses related to SEC reporting, including the re-classification of sales-related management expenses, in connection with the projected growth of our business. Additionally, we continue to incur specific one-time costs in relation to our planned Nasdaq Capital Markets uplist, additional financing activities and related functions, and an increase in other professional service fees.

The decrease in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to increased pull-through of deals in Q4 of 2021  both by the Company and our customers who took advantage of prepaid multi-year discounts and also took advantage of multi-year commitments to our SaaS products and other software product offerings.
