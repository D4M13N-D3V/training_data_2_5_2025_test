Adding onto Fortas deployments resulting in large scale vulnerabilities, Globalscape is no different. Worse off than their other zero-day exposures from GlobalScape, Fortas overall customer base continue to learn about ongoing breaches of their data directly, or via data transfer partners. Unfortunately news of more breached customers continue to be published.

    "content": "### Security Guidance for Data Protection and Safe Usage\n\n#### 1. **Easy-to-Follow Security Best Practices**\n   - **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Ensure all user accounts, especially those with administrative privileges, use MFA to add an extra layer of security.\n   - **Keep Software Updated:** Regularly update your Managed File Transfer (MFT) solution, protocols, and related software to protect against vulnerabilities and exploits.\n   - **Use Strong Encryption:** Always use end-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest to prevent unauthorized access.\n   - **Limit Access:** Apply the principle of least privilege\u2014only grant access to necessary users, systems, or applications.\n   - **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Implement logging and monitoring tools to detect and respond to potential security incidents quickly.\n\n#### 2. **Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Secure File Transfer Protocols:** Use protocols like SFTP, HTTPS, or FTPS instead of unsecured options like FTP or HTTP.\n   - **Encrypt Sensitive Data:** Encrypt sensitive data before transferring it, even if the transfer protocol supports encryption.\n   - **-metadata Protection:** Ensure metadata (e.g., file names, user info) is protected, as it can contain sensitive information.\n   - **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular audits of data transfers to identify and mitigate potential risks.\n   - **Backup Data:** Maintain backups of critical data to ensure business continuity in case of a breach or data loss.\n\n#### 3. **Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Verify Recipients:** Always confirm the identity of the recipient before sending sensitive data.\n   - **Avoid Public Wi-Fi:** Refrain from using public Wi-Fi for transferring sensitive data, as it may not be secure.\n   - **Use Secure Devices:** Only use trusted, up-to-date devices for data transfers to minimize the risk of compromise.\n   - **Avoid Unapproved Tools:** Stick to approved MFT solutions and avoid using unapproved tools or services for sensitive data transfers.\n   - **Train Users:** Educate users on secure data transfer practices to reduce the risk of human error.\n\n#### 4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Phishing Attacks:** Be cautious of phishing attempts that may trick users into revealing credentials or transferring data insecurely.\n   - **Weak Passwords:** Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts and change them regularly.\n   - **Insider Threats:** Monitor for unauthorized access or suspicious activity by internal users.\n   - **Malware:** Regularly scan for and update protections against malware, ransomware, and other threats.\n   - **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Stay informed about zero-day exploits and apply patches promptly to mitigate risks.\n\n#### 5. **Privacy Protection Measures**\n   - **Compliance with Regulations:** Ensure your data transfer practices comply with relevant regulations like GDPR, CCPA, or HIPAA.\n   - **Minimize Data Sharing:** Only share data on a need-to-know basis and avoid over-collection of personal or sensitive information.\n   - **Data Anonymization:** Consider anonymizing or pseudonymizing data where possible to reduce privacy risks.\n   - **Consent Management:** Obtain explicit consent before transferring or processing personal data.\n   - **Data Retention Policies:** Establish clear policies for how long data is retained and ensure it is securely deleted when no longer needed.\n\n#### 6. **When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n   - **After a Breach:** If you suspect or confirm a breach, immediately contact your security team or a professional incident response service.\n   - **Complex Implementations:** For large-scale or complex data transfer solutions, consider consulting with security experts.\n   - **Regulatory Uncertainty:** If you\u2019re unsure about compliance with specific regulations, seek advice from a privacy or legal expert.\n   - **Custom Solutions:** For custom-built or specialized data transfer needs, engage with security professionals to ensure the solution is secure.\n   - **Ongoing Monitoring:** If your organization lacks the resources to monitor and respond to security threats, consider outsourcing to a managed security service provider.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly improve the security and privacy of your data transfers and protect against common risks. Always stay vigilant and adapt your practices as threats and technologies evolve.",
