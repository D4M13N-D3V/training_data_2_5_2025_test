Much of my interest has been towards how to provide more authenticity to transactions and secure the history of contentdata  to a forensic level if required for certain types of data and who doesnt want to be 100 sure of data? Todays security tech largely sits out on an island on its own  usually only contextually focused on its specific use cases and not playing well with others. SIEM and log providers have done a decent job of at least bringing data together focused on specific use cases  but there is a long way to go. The following article was an interesting albeit short read about the impact of blockchains on security tech   . As folks like Ripple come up with true business-supported blockchains  the opportunity for change is significantly larger than most predictions the timing is coming right online for some big moves in this area. Having the support of IBM and others for HyperLedger, Google, Microsoft and AWS offering their compute fabrics to host xyz ledgers  the promises of the technology are coming to the forefront for businesses of all sizes to take advantage of. Internet security online business concept pointing security services Online Security Check and Privacy Concept. Fingerprint and Computer Police Database Scan. Person Screening. This is a topical change to the industry as we  DATA443 are focused heavily on data security, management and destruction  something blockchains in general help considerably with. We are excited for the changes  both as technologists and business people  and fully expect to take advantage of the market opportunity.
