The decrease in revenue in the second quarter was primarily due to our ongoing shift for some products from one-time sales perpetual licenses with annual maintenance contracts to time-based subscriptions with multiyear upfront payments this shift resulted in fewer customers paying for subscriptions or renewals in the quarter. General and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, were 1,579,529, compared to 1,065,619 for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, an increase of 48. The increase in general and administrative expense primarily consisted of management costs, costs to integrate assets we acquired and to expand sales, product enhancements, audit and review fees, filing fees, professional fees, and other expenses related to SEC reporting, including the re-classification of sales-related management expenses, in connection with the projected growth of our business. Additionally, we continue to incur specific one-time costs in relation to our planned Nasdaq Capital Markets uplist, additional financing activities and related functions, and an increase in other professional service fees. The net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 was 1,582,720, compared to a loss of 974,124 for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 it was mainly derived from an operating loss of 786,663, and interest expense of 796,057.

Financial Highlights for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Total revenues were 2,279,677 during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to 3,095,279 of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to increased pull-through of deals in Q4 of 2021  both by the Company and our customers who took advantage of prepaid multi-year discounts and also took advantage of multi-year commitments to our SaaS products and other software product offerings. Total deferred revenues were 2,652,382 as of September 30, 2022, compared with 1,608,596 of deferred revenues as of December 31, 2021  representing an increase of 65.

    "content": "### Practical Data Security and Protection Guidance\n\n#### **1. Security Best Practices**\n- **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**: Always use complex passwords (at least 12 characters) and avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts. Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate passwords.\n- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Activate MFA wherever possible, especially for critical accounts like email, cloud storage, and banking services.\n- **Regularly Update Software**: Keep your operating systems, applications, and devices updated to the latest versions to patch security vulnerabilities.\n- **Backup Your Data**: Implement regular, automated backups of important data to an external drive or cloud storage service. Use the \"3-2-1\" rule: three copies, two different media, and one offsite copy.\n\n#### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use encryption for sensitive data, both at rest (stored) and in transit (being sent over a network). Tools like BitLocker (for Windows) or FileVault (for macOS) can encrypt your hard drive.\n- **Secure Cloud Storage**: When using cloud services, ensure data is encrypted before uploading. Use reputable providers that offer robust security features.\n- **Limit Data Access**: Only grant access to sensitive data to those who absolutely need it. Use role-based access controls to minimize exposure.\n\n#### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Spot Phishing Attempts**: Be cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or calls asking for personal or financial information. Verify the sender\u2019s identity before responding or clicking on links.\n- **Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Tasks**: Refrain from accessing sensitive accounts or transferring confidential data over public Wi-Fi networks. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) if you must connect to public Wi-Fi.\n- **Download Carefully**: Only download software or files from trusted sources. Avoid peer-to-peer networks and unverified websites.\n\n#### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Ransomware**: Regularly back up your data and ensure backups are stored offline or in a secure cloud service. Avoid opening suspicious email attachments or links that could trigger ransomware.\n- **Insider Threats**: Monitor user activity and implement access controls to prevent unauthorized changes or deletions of data.\n- **Malware**: Install and regularly update antivirus/antimalware software. Scan files and emails before opening them.\n- **Physical Theft**: Secure devices and storage media. Use a cable lock for laptops and store backups in a safe location.\n\n#### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Data Minimization**: Collect and store only the data you need. Avoid keeping unnecessary sensitive information.\n- **Dispose of Data Safely**: When disposing of devices or media, use secure wiping methods (e.g., DoD wipe) or physical destruction.\n- **Anonymize Data**: Consider anonymizing or pseudonymizing data where possible to protect individual identities.\n\n#### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- **After a Data Breach**: If you suspect or confirm a breach, contact a cybersecurity professional immediately to assess and mitigate damage.\n- **Handling Sensitive Data**: If you\u2019re working with highly sensitive data (e.g., financial records, personal identifiable information), consult with a security expert to ensure proper protection measures are in place.\n- **Complex Systems**: If you\u2019re managing complex systems or large-scale data storage, engage with a security analyst to review your setup and identify vulnerabilities.\n- **Compliance Requirements**: If your organization must comply with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA, seek guidance from a compliance specialist to ensure you\u2019re meeting legal obligations.\n\nBy following these practical steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and protect your sensitive information. Stay proactive and remain informed about emerging threats to maintain a strong security posture.",
