Jizhong Chen had been working for Apple for about six months, signing a strict confidentiality oath upon being hired. According to another Apple employee, Chen was seen photographing within the secure facility January 11. Stealing Data Without Obstacles Worse than, perhaps, the photographs taken, were the 2,000 documents Chen backed up to his personal hard drive, including manuals and schematics for the Apple project. Data stolen included architecture diagrams and assembly drawings. Apple could have prevented any file stealing and data breach from both Chen and an additional Chinese engineer in July 2018 with data classification.
