Legitimate emails usually address you by name and have proper formatting.\n   - **Hover Over Links**: Before clicking, hover over links to preview the URL. Avoid clicking on suspicious links.\n   - **Verify Senders**: Check the email address for typos or slight alterations that may indicate spoofing.\n   - **Attachments**: Avoid opening attachments from unknown sources. Verify via a different method if unsure.\n   - **Report Suspicious Emails**: Use a dedicated email or button to report suspicious emails to IT.\n   - **Regular Training**: Participate in quarterly phishing training or simulations.\n   - **Keep Software Updated**: Regularly update software to patch vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Data Protection Recommendations**\n\n   - **Strong Passwords**: Use passphrases and consider a password manager. Avoid reusing passwords.\n   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enable MFA wherever possible for added security.\n   - **Backup Data**: Follow the 3-2-1 rule: three copies, two media types, one offsite.\n   - **Encryption**: Use encryption for sensitive data, both at rest and in transit.\n\n3. **Safe Usage Guidelines**\n\n   - **Avoid Public Computers/Wi-Fi**: Refrain from using public devices or Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks.\n   - **Log Out Properly**: Always log out from accounts, especially on shared devices.\n\n4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n\n   - **Phishing**: Recognize types (email, phone, text). Be cautious with unsolicited requests.\n   - **Social Engineering**: Verify identities and be wary of unsolicited calls.\n   - **Ransomware**: Regular backups are crucial; avoid paying ransoms unless necessary.\n\n5. **Privacy Protection Measures**\n\n   - **Limit Data Sharing**: Only share necessary personal information.\n   - **Use Privacy Settings**: Adjust social media settings to limit exposure.\n   - **Encrypt Data**: Protect sensitive information with encryption.\n   - **Be Cautious with Apps**: Review permissions before granting access.\n\n6. **When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n\n   - **Suspicious Activity**: Contact IT immediately if something seems off.\n   - **Report Incidents Quickly**: Prompt reporting helps minimize damage.\n\n---\n\nThis guidance is designed to be clear and actionable, helping users enhance their security practices without overwhelming them."
