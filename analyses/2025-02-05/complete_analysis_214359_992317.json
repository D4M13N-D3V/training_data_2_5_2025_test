Thats because SEGs scan incoming messages once, by referencing a database of known threats. Many SEGS, such as Microsoft Defender, have a feature called Microsoft Safe Links , which adds add time-of-Click Protection URL re-writing. This gives users a second chance to catch phishing threats as they click links in message bodies. This measure still relies on databases of known threats and attackers easily defeat it by simply putting the URLs in attachments or other basic evasion technique. Meanwhile Spear phishing and Business Email Compromise BEC attacks dont contain URLs or attachments , so they appear harmless to the SEG. Cousin domains are used to obfuscate URLs. Attackers serve up local versions of a spoofed site, so the domain looks legitimate.
