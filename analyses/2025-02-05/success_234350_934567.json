Dridex Targets UK With a New Set of Guns April 13, 2017 In the midst of the recent revival of Dridex, the notorious family of banking trojans, a Dridex attack scheme targeted at stealing UK users online banking credentials was detected this week and is being blocked by Cyrens security cloud. This new attack is initiated by an email PDF attachment claiming to be a confirmation letter or scanned document, then proceeds as shown below by our step-by-step security lab analysis. This is a different tack from the most common recent reports of Dridex attacking Windows users through spam campaigns with attached RTF documents with a .doc or .zip extension, which exploit a zero-day phishing vulnerability in Microsoft Word identified as CVE-2017-0199. Upon opening the PDF, which Cyren detects as JSDridLdr.A!Eldorado, the user is prompted with a notification that an embedded file is to be automatically opened. The embedded document is automatically opened through a PDF OpenAction event using the following PDF javascript code. uk_confirmation_ph975721850.pdf --- PDF Object 12 ---  TypeCatalogPages 8 0 RNames 11 0 ROpenAction  SJavaScriptJS 5 0 R   --- PDF Object 5 --- var a43ifa10023alerta2 this.exportDataObject cName 20170406824631.docm, nLaunch 2  Scan_776850.pdf --- PDF Object 11 ---  TypeCatalogPages 7 0 RNames 10 0 ROpenAction  SJavaScriptJS var a11ifa50alerta this.exportDataObject cName ScanData309093.docm, nLaunch 2    The exportDataObject function takes two parameters, cName and nLaunch. cName specifies the file attachment to be exported from the PDF and nLaunch, with a value of 2, directs the reader to save the attachment to a temporary file and ask the operating system to open it. In this case, an OpenXML-formatted macro-enabled document .DOCM is opened by Windows with Microsoft Word. The exported document is detected by Cyren as PP97MDownldr.gen. By default, Microsoft Word disables the automatic execution of VBA macros and will prompt the user with a notification similar to the snapshot below. Once the user enables the content, the VBA macro code is automatically executed with the use of the AutoOpen method. Similar to a few variants of macro-based malware, this variant stores a few of its needed strings in user form controls to evade analysis from known tools and scanners. The code attempts to download an encrypted executable from one of the listed URLs in its code medredacted.comkjv783r outofredacted.orgkjv783r jenya.redacted.comkjv783r sseleman.redacted.com874hv americasphotostudio.redacted.net874hv majestic-redacted.com874hv The downloaded data is decrypted using XOR operations with a 32-byte key hard-coded in the VBA code, saved in the Windows temporary directory using the filename redchip.exe and executed through the Shell.Application.Open method. The decrypted executable is detected by Cyren as W32Dridex.KJ.gen!Eldorado and confirmed to employ the new code injection known as AtomBombing. Researchers from IBM X-Force has published a detailed report on how Dridex exploits AtomBombing to inject its code into selected system processes to attain persistence and evade detection. Once it has found a target process to inject into, it gathers the following system information Computer name User name Operating system install date The gathered information is concatenated together with a 2-byte seed using the following format ComputerNameUserName00InstallDate2-byte seed Dridex generates the MD5 Hash from this built string, then converts it into GUID string format as shown below. 0012F44C 00C28AE0 ASCII 89bd3ac962a1ebc0e9112f6111f0f5eb 0012EEBC 7FFDFC00 UNICODE 89bd3ac9-62a1-ebc0-e911-2f6111f0f5eb This GUID is then used for the checking and creation of mutex names, event names and probably keys.

    "content": "### Security Guidance for End Users: Data Protection and Safe Practices\n\nTo help protect yourself and your organization from cyber threats like the Dridex banking trojan and other malicious attacks, here are some practical, easy-to-follow security recommendations:\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Email Safety and Phishing Prevention**\n- **Be cautious with attachments and links:** Avoid opening unsolicited PDFs, DOCM files, or other attachments from unknown or suspicious senders. Dridex campaigns often use legitimate-looking emails to trick users.\n- **Verify the sender:** Before interacting with an email, check the sender's email address to ensure it\u2019s legitimate. Look for spelling mistakes or unusual domains.\n- **Do not enable macros:** If a document prompts you to enable macros or content, do not do so unless you are certain the file is safe. Macros are a common way for malware like Dridex to infect systems.\n- **Hover over links:** Before clicking on links, hover over them to see the full URL. If it looks suspicious or doesn\u2019t match the context of the email, avoid clicking.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Backup your data:** Regularly back up your important files to an external drive, cloud storage, or both. This ensures you can recover your data in case of an attack or ransomware.\n- **Use strong passwords:** Protect your online accounts with unique, complex passwords. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts.\n- **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Whenever possible, enable MFA for your online accounts to add an extra layer of security.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Keep software updated:** Regularly update your operating system, Microsoft Office, and other software to patch vulnerabilities that attackers like Dridex exploit.\n- **Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks:** Public Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured, making it easier for attackers to intercept your data. Avoid accessing online banking or sensitive accounts over public Wi-Fi.\n- **Monitor your accounts:** Regularly check your bank statements and online accounts for unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, contact your bank or service provider immediately.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Malware risks:** Be aware of malicious documents or attachments, especially those that prompt you to enable macros or download additional files. Dridex and similar malware often use these tactics to infect systems.\n- **Phishing risks:** Phishing attacks are one of the most common ways attackers gain access to systems. Stay vigilant and never provide sensitive information in response to unsolicited emails or calls.\n- **Social engineering risks:** Attackers may use convincing emails or calls to trick you into taking actions that compromise your security. Always verify the authenticity of requests before taking action.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Use encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data, especially when sharing it via email or storing it in the cloud.\n- **Limit personal information sharing:** Be cautious about sharing personal or financial information online. Only provide this information on secure, trusted websites.\n- ** Disable unnecessary features:** Turn off unnecessary features on your devices, such as Bluetooth or location services, when not in use to reduce your exposure to potential risks.\n\n---\n\n#### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- If you suspect your system has been infected with malware like Dridex, immediately disconnect from the internet and contact your IT department or a cybersecurity professional.\n- If you\u2019ve accidentally clicked on a suspicious link or opened a malicious document, report the incident to your organization\u2019s security team right away.\n- If you notice unauthorized transactions or account activity, contact your bank or service provider immediately to report the issue and request assistance.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Best Practices\n- **Stay informed:** Educate yourself about the latest cyber threats, attack methods, and security best practices. Many organizations offer free cybersecurity training resources or phishing simulations to help employees stay safe.\n- **Use antivirus and anti-malware tools:** Install and regularly update antivirus software to detect and block malicious files like those used in Dridex campaigns.\n- **Delete suspicious emails:** If an email looks suspicious or you\u2019re unsure about its legitimacy, delete it without clicking on any links or opening attachments.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to cyberattacks like Dridex and protect your sensitive data. Stay vigilant and proactive in your security habits!",
