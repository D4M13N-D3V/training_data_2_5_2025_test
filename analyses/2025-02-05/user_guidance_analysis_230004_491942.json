As its name suggests, it is a mechanism for ascertaining that a real human is performing an action at a web site. CAPTCHA is generated by distorting letters and numbers in such a way that a computer using OCR cannot resolve it. Typical applications were originally centered on authentication. For example, if you enter an incorrect password multiple times, you might be presented with a CAPTCHA to ensure that a bot is not attempting to brute force a login. Today there are other applications, such as preventing bots automatically posting good product reviews to falsify scores on review sites. Hiding phishing sites behind CAPTCHA Phishing evasion tactics have evolved over time, each a new attempt to thwart cyber security companies, who, in turn, evolved their detection techniques. The latest tactic Cyrens security analysts are seeing on the increase is extremely simple. If you dont want security companies automated crawlers, bots and user agents to be able to access your phishing page, simply control that access using a mechanism devised specifically to block computers  CAPTCHA. Like the use of block lists, if the phishing page cannot be reached, even the best detection engine cannot do its job. If it is so simple, one might ask why it has not been widely used. The answer is that for it to be successful, it has to be presented prior to the phishing page, and this is unusual. Most users expect a CAPTCHA to appear on the same page as the request for credentials, and this unusual behaviour might lead perceptive users to realize they are being phished. Phishers are using multiple CAPTCHAs CAPTCHA has evolved over the years, with projects dubbed reCAPTCHA created to improve security and reduce user friction. Techniques now include a simple checkbox, clicking images that include specific objects, and tracking human-like behaviors. The latter requires no human intervention at all, so is not an appropriate evasive phishing technique, but Cyrens security lab have seen all other variants. This makes life even more difficult for cyber security companies, who have to figure out how to defeat each of the tactics in use. Here are a few examples found recently by Cyrens security analysts. A simple CAPTCHA that controls access to a PayPal phishing site CAPTCHA controlling access to an Apple phishing site. Note the URL attempts to appear as a genuine apple.com site, but the actual domain is apps-personal.services. When a cyber security companys bots, crawlers or analysts come across phishing evasion techniques, their very existence raises suspicion. For example, if a security bot attempts to access a suspected phishing page and is blocked, because its IP addresses are included in the phishers block lists, that very behavior is noted as potentially suspicious. The next step in this situation might be to access the page from an IP address unknown to the phishers, and if a different response is received, suspicion is increased significantly. Before discovering this new CAPTCHA evasion tactic, reaching a CAPTCHA page was not deemed suspicious, but now detection has evolved to understand how this combines with other attributes of the attack, to ensure that users are protected.

This could indicate a phishing attempt.\n   - Check the URL: Ensure it matches the service you're using. Suspicious or mismatched URLs are red flags.\n\n### 2. **Verifying Site Authenticity**\n   - If prompted for sensitive information after solving a CAPTCHA, verify the site's authenticity by contacting the company through an official channel.\n   - Avoid using provided links; instead, type the official URL or use a bookmark.\n\n### 3. **Avoiding Information Disclosure**\n   - Refrain from sharing sensitive information if requested after solving a CAPTCHA. Phishers may use this tactic to harvest your data.\n\n### 4. **Keeping Software Updated**\n   - Regularly update your browser and security software to benefit from the latest security patches that can detect and block evasive phishing tactics.\n\n### 5. **Reporting Suspicious Activity**\n   - Report phishing attempts to your email provider or the company being impersonated. This helps in taking down phishing sites and protecting others.\n\n### 6. **Enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**\n   - Activate 2FA wherever possible.
