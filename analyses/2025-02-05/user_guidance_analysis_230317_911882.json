June 11, 2018 Im a technology marketer, and the annual Infosecurity and RSA security events are an opportunity for me to understand what my peers and competitors are saying to customers and potential customers. This year, as always, the events were similar. My takeaway from both is that many in the industry appear to be telling customers to shift the burden of protection to the end-user. As usual, my walk around the exhibit halls turned up a massive number of vendors whose booth messaging was completely incomprehensible. Im sure you looked at many booths and still did not know what problem the vendor might solve for you. Others did far better, with straight-forward headlines stating what they do. Some used games to attract people, and some, magicians, including Cyren. We thought it a fun way to engage and our magicians act was closely linked to our theme of How do you know your security is working? You know your security is not working when you focus all your efforts on blaming users for successful attacks. Yes, user training does form part of a defence-in-depth strategy, but a small part, and it only works if you continuously reinforce it using professional training companies. Doing this right is not within everyones budget. Yet there were an abundance of companies touting training, specifically to help detect email phishing threats. Is this really the users responsibility? We dont expect them to delete their own spam or avoid clicking executable malware attachments, but we seem to have given up on technologys ability to block phishing. And we actually get two attempts at doing so  when the email arrives over the email channel and when the user connects to the phishing site over the web channel. Surely at least one of either the email or the web security controls can protect the users. Not only are these user-education companies telling us that users are the weak link, but some of the larger infosec companies are too, with booths decked in messaging suggesting that protection starts with people. I agree that we should be thinking about how users work, what they do and how it affects the security posture of the business, but does security really start with them? Should IT not be an enabler to help them be more productive and should security not just protect them invisibly? The answer is, of course, yes. My advice is do not let your email security vendor get away with delivering phishing emails to your users  they should just block them. Do not let your web security vendor get away with allowing users to connect to phishing sites  they should just block the connections. Do you know whether they are or not? It is difficult to tell because your users might be giving away login credentials or other information and they may never realise.

Here are some clear, actionable steps to help you stay safe and secure:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Security Best Practices**\n- **Use Strong Passwords**:  \n  - Create unique, complex passwords for every account. A good password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.  \n  - Avoid using the same password across multiple accounts.  \n  - Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate strong passwords.\n\n- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:  \n  - 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to your phone or a biometric scan) when logging into an account.  \n  - Enable 2FA wherever it\u2019s available, especially for critical accounts like email, banking, and social media.\n\n- **Regularly Update Your Software**:  \n  - Keep your operating system, browser, and applications up to date. Updates often include security patches that protect against known vulnerabilities.  \n  - Enable automatic updates to make this process seamless.\n\n- **Be Wary of Public Wi-Fi**:  \n  - Avoid accessing sensitive accounts (e.g., banking, email) when connected to public Wi-Fi. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Backup Your Data**:  \n  - Regularly back up important files to an external drive or a secure cloud storage service (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive).  \n  - Use the 3-2-1 backup rule: three copies of your data, two different storage types, and one offsite backup.\n\n- **Encrypt Sensitive Information**:  \n  - Use encryption for sensitive files or communications. Tools like VeraCrypt (for files) or Signal (for messaging) can help protect your data.\n\n- **Delete Data Safely**:  \n  - When disposing of devices or files, use secure deletion methods to ensure your data cannot be recovered. Tools like DBAN or built-in secure erase features can help.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Spot Phishing Attempts**:  \n  - Be cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or calls asking for personal information or login credentials.  \n  - Look for red flags like spelling mistakes, unusual sender addresses, or urgent language.  \n  - Verify requests by contacting the organization directly through a trusted channel.\n\n- **Avoid Suspicious Links and Downloads**:  \n  - Never click on links or download attachments from unfamiliar sources.  \n  - Hover over links to see the full URL before clicking. If it looks suspicious, don\u2019t proceed.\n\n- **Use Trusted Apps and Sources**:  \n  - Only download apps from official app stores (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play).  \n  - Read user reviews and check permissions before installing an app.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Ransomware**:  \n  - Ransomware encrypts your files and demands payment for their release.  \n  - Prevent ransomware by avoiding suspicious downloads, keeping backups, and ensuring your security software is up to date.\n\n- **Social Engineering**:  \n  - Attackers may try to manipulate you into revealing sensitive information.  \n  - Always verify requests for information, especially if they seem urgent or unusual.\n\n- **Malware**:  \n  - Use reputable antivirus software and a firewall to detect and block malicious programs.  \n  - Avoid executable files from untrusted sources.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Limit Personal Data Sharing**:  \n  - Be cautious about sharing personal information online, especially on social media or public forums.  \n  - Use privacy settings on platforms to restrict who can see your information.\n\n- **Use Privacy Tools**:  \n  - Consider using a VPN to mask your IP address and encrypt your internet traffic.  \n  - Use privacy-focused browsers like Brave or Firefox with ad-blockers and tracking protection.\n\n- **Monitor Your Accounts**:  \n  - Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized transactions.  \n  - Use tools like Google\u2019s Privacy Checkup or Apple\u2019s Privacy Report to monitor app permissions.\n\n---\n\n### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- If you suspect your account or device has been compromised, act quickly:  \n  - Change your passwords immediately.  \n  - Run a full scan with your antivirus software.  \n  - Contact your bank or service provider if financial information may be at risk.\n\n- If your organization experiences a breach or advanced threat, seek professional help:  \n  - Engage incident response teams or cybersecurity experts to contain and remediate the issue.  \n\n- Stay informed about emerging threats:  \n  -Subscribe to security newsletters or follow trusted sources like SANS Institute or Krebs on Security for updates on the latest risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\nWhile user awareness is important, it\u2019s not the only solution. Technology should play a significant role in protecting you. Make sure your email and web security tools are blocking threats effectively, and don\u2019t hesitate to test their performance with tools like [Cyren\u2019s Web Security Diagnostic](https://www.cyren.com) or Email Security Gap Analysis.
