We delivered strong results that were on target and to our forecasts. We continue to make solid progress toward achieving our long-term goals in delivering a complete data privacy, security and governance ecosystem that is unique and unrivaled in the marketplace. Our product portfolio continues to deliver value to the marketplace and provide diversified revenue streams for the company  especially valuable particularly at these challenging times. Continued high margin-based product lines are contributing to our growing bottom line. 2019 represents these roll up businesses reporting only approximately 1.5 and 2.75 quarters contributing for the fiscal  thus enabling for significant expected contributions for 2020. We have made great strides in executing on our vision for success, to position Data443 as a leading provider of data privacy and security services that meet the growing challenges faced by organizations in highly regulated, risk and compliance-intensive markets. Weve acquired long-standing businesses with high quality intellectual property and talent, producing monthly recurring revenue with very strong renewal rates. Weve successfully integrated these businesses within Data443, providing our clients with a growing portfolio of services at their disposal. In the current COVID-19 environment, we are fortunate that our services continue to be used by a diverse group of customers whose businesses are continuing to operate, with several considered to be an essential service. We are highly engaged with our customers helping them to navigate the new challenges they are facing, continuing to fully service their needs during these difficult times. Our employees remain fully engaged, and we believe our business continuity plan is working well. We are the only organization in the marketplace that provides the effective end to end solution for privacy compliance management. Our most recent launch of the Global Privacy Manager back ended by the leading ClassiDocs product is indicative of the end to end solution  providing a privacy management solution for clients of all sizes, in all locations with clients of all types. Our mission is to provide capabilities for all of these customers and enable them immediately at prices and onboarding times that are consumable and relevant to their needs. As the California AG has reiterated as recently as last week  the CCPA will be enforced with rigor starting July 2020 and we look forward to helping our customers through these trying times. In conclusion, I want to thank our loyal employees, customers and shareholders for your continued support. Much like many other microcap companies, our stock price today clearly doesnt represent what I believe to be the underlying value of Data443. We continue to improve execution, drive additional revenue and close acquisitions that are accretive and fit within our unique framework, concluded Mr. Remillard.
