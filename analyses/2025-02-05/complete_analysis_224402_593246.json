      "user_guidance": "### Security Guidance for LinkedIn Users\n\nTo help protect yourself and your data on LinkedIn, follow these practical security recommendations:\n\n#### 1. Security Best Practices\n- **Verify Connections:** Always verify the authenticity of connection requests. Check the requester's profile for completeness, the number of connections, and whether they work at a reputable organization.\n- **Be Cautious with New Accounts:** If a connection request comes from a newly created account, be extra vigilant. Scammers often create fake profiles to impersonate legitimate users.\n- **Avoid Oversharing:** Refrain from sharing sensitive personal or professional information publicly. Only share what is necessary for your professional networking goals.\n\n#### 2. Data Protection Recommendations\n- **Use LinkedIn\u2019s Built-in Security Tools:** Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your LinkedIn account to add an extra layer of security.\n- **Limit Sharing of Sensitive Information:** Be cautious about sharing sensitive data, such as your email address, phone number, or project details, publicly or with connections you don\u2019t trust.\n- **Monitor Account Activity:** Regularly review your account for any suspicious activity, such as unfamiliar login attempts or connection requests.\n\n#### 3. Safe Usage Guidelines\n- **Avoid Suspicious Links:**Never click on links from unsolicited messages, even if they appear to be from someone you know. Hover over the link to see the URL before clicking.\n- **Report Suspicious Activity:** If you encounter a suspicious message or connection request, report it to LinkedIn immediately.\n- **Use Strong Passwords:** Ensure your LinkedIn password is unique and complex. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple platforms.\n\n#### 4. Common Security Risks and Prevention\n- **Phishing Attacks:** Be wary of phishing attempts disguised as connection requests, messages, or InMail. Attackers may use these to steal your credentials or gain access to your network.\n  - **Prevention:** Look out for generic greetings, poor grammar, and urgent requests. Verify the sender\u2019s identity before responding.\n- **Social Engineering:** Scammers may try to manipulate you into revealing sensitive information by posing as colleagues, recruiters, or business partners.\n  - **Prevention:** Be cautious of requests that ask for personal or financial information. Verify identities through official channels before responding.\n\n#### 5. Privacy Protection Measures\n- **Adjust Privacy Settings:** Regularly review and update your LinkedIn privacy settings to control who can see your profile, activity, and connections.\n- **Limit Visibility:** Consider making your profile visible only to your connections or people in your network to reduce the risk of unwanted attention.\n- **Be Mindful of Public Posts:** Avoid sharing confidential or sensitive information in public posts or comments.\n\n#### 6. When to Seek Additional Security Support\n- **Receive Suspicious Messages:** If you receive a message that seems fraudulent or suspicious, report it to LinkedIn and consider informing your organization\u2019s security team.\n- **Suspect a Security Breach:** If you suspect your account has been compromised, immediately change your password, enable 2FA, and contact LinkedIn support.\n- **Unsure About a Connection:** If you\u2019re unsure whether a connection request is legitimate, reach out to the person through another verified channel (e.g., email or phone) to confirm their identity.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing, identity theft, and other security threats on LinkedIn. Stay vigilant, and remember that it\u2019s always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your online security."
