July 16, 2020 Companies worldwide are up against sophisticated email attacks like Business Email Compromises BEC . These attacks are also known as spear phishing, impersonation, and whaling, with the goal of convincing an end-user to release money or provide account information. Related Microsoft 365 Is Wildly Successful and Profoundly Vulnerable  Heres Why One method of phishing is known as a Phishing URL. In this attack, you receive an email from Microsoft asking you to verify your credentials. The email looks completely normal, but what lurks behind the verify button isnt. The goal here is to steal your account password or other confidential information by tricking you into believing youre on a legitimate website. Its effective, and even tricked savvy tech reporters on this classic Reply All episode What Kind Of Idiot Gets Phished? If youre already using an email gateway and URL wrapping, good for you! But youre only halfway there. When an email hits your email gateway, its scanned and then delivered to your inbox. The gateway checked the emails links against a database and the results came back clean. We can relax, right? What your SEG doesnt see? The verify your credentials email from Microsoft actually links to a cooking website. Since that site is real, the email sailed through. Then 5 minutes later, the clever attackers redirect the URL from the cooking site to a known Microsoft phishing site. We call this method a delayed detonation. Time to layer Inbox Detection and Response on top of SEGs Inbox Security is a new technology that puts inbox detection and response right inside the mailbox. Advanced algorithms look at where the email came from, review the header information, and even follow the links. All in real-time. The system is continually monitoring the users mailbox, finding phishing emails, tagging them, and moving them to their junk mail folder. Without disruptions to the user. What happens to our delayed detonation while using Inbox Detection and Response? When this email detonated, the Inbox Security system saw the URL now goes to a known phishing website. The system removed the suspicious message from the inbox and from all infected mailboxes across the organization to boot.

      "user_guidance": "### Security Guidance for End Users: Best Practices and Data Protection\n\nStaying safe in the digital world requires a combination of awareness, smart habits, and the right tools. Below are practical, easy-to-follow security recommendations to help you protect yourself and your organization from evolving threats like phishing, BEC (Business Email Compromise), and other sophisticated attacks.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Email Safety and Phishing Awareness**\n- **Verify the Sender**: Always check the sender's email address. Scammers often mimic legitimate companies but may have slight typos or odd domains (e.g., `microsoft-support.info` instead of `microsoft.com`).\n- **Be Cautious with Links and Buttons**: Hover over links to see where they lead before clicking. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or buttons, especially in unsolicited emails.\n- **Watch for Urgency and Emotional Appeals**: Phishing emails often create a sense of panic (e.g., \"Your account will be closed if you don't act now\").\n- **Never Open Suspicious Attachments**: Attachments from unknown senders could contain malware or ransomware.\n- **Use the \"Report\" Button**: Most email platforms allow you to report phishing emails. Use this feature to help improve spam filters.\n\n**Pro Tip**: If an email asks you to \"verify your credentials\" or \"reset your password,\" go directly to the official website instead of clicking the link in the email.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**\n- **What It Does**: MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to your phone or a fingerprint) in addition to your password.\n- **Why It's Important**: Even if your password is compromised, MFA makes it much harder for attackers to access your account.\n- **Where to Use It**: Enable MFA for all critical accounts (e.g., email, banking, cloud storage).\n\n**Pro Tip**: Use an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator) instead of SMS-based MFA, as it\u2019s more secure.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Back Up Regularly**: Use cloud backup services (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox) and external hard drives to safeguard important files.\n- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use encryption for sensitive files or communications, especially when sharing them via email or other platforms.\n- **Use Strong Passwords**: Choose unique, complex passwords for each account. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple platforms.\n- **Secure Your Devices**: Enable full-disk encryption on your laptop or desktop to protect data in case the device is lost or stolen.\n\n**Pro Tip**: Use a password manager (e.g., LastPass, 1Password) to generate and store complex passwords securely.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Safe Browsing Habits**\n- **Avoid Suspicious Websites**: Be cautious when clicking on links from unfamiliar sources. Look for \"https://\" in the URL and a padlock icon to ensure the site is secure.\n- **Keep Your Browser and Plugins Updated**: Outdated software can leave you vulnerable to known exploits. Enable automatic updates for your browser, operating system, and plugins.\n- **Type URLs Manually**: Instead of clicking links in emails, type the URL of well-known sites (e.g., your bank or Microsoft) directly into your browser.\n\n**Pro Tip**: Use browser extensions like uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger to block malicious scripts and trackers.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Be Aware of Common Security Risks**\n- **Phishing URLs**: These can lead to fake login pages designed to steal your credentials. Always verify the URL before entering sensitive information.\n- **Delayed Detonation Attacks**: Some phishing emails may seem safe initially but redirect to malicious sites minutes or hours later. Use advanced email security tools to monitor for these threats.\n- **Whaling Attacks**: These are targeted phishing attacks aimed at high-level executives or decision-makers. Be extra cautious with emails that appear to come from your CEO or other senior leaders.\n- **Social Engineering**: Attackers may call or email you pretending to be from a trusted organization (e.g., your bank or IT department) to trick you into revealing sensitive information. Always verify the caller's identity independently.\n\n**Pro Tip**: Train yourself and your team to spot red flags in emails, such as poor grammar, unexpected requests, or PUSHY language.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Use a VPN**: A virtual private network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers to intercept your data on public Wi-Fi networks.\n- **Limit App Permissions**: Only grant apps the permissions they absolutely need. For example, a calculator app doesn\u2019t need access to your location or contacts.\n- **Enable Privacy Settings**: Review and adjust privacy settings on social media platforms and other online accounts to limit who can see your personal information.\n- **Shred Sensitive Documents**: Dispose of physical documents containing personal or financial information securely.\n\n**Pro Tip**: Use privacy-focused browsers like Brave or Tor for extra protection against tracking.\n\n---\n\n### **7. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- **If You Suspect a Breach**: Contact your IT department or a cybersecurity professional immediately if you believe your account or device has been compromised.\n- **For Advanced Threats**: Use inbox detection and response tools (e.g., Cyren Inbox Security) to monitor and remove phishing emails in real time.\n- **Custom Solutions**: If your organization handles sensitive data, consult with cybersecurity experts to implement layered security measures (e.g., email gateways, URL wrapping, and advanced threat detection).\n\n**Pro Tip**: Regularly review your organization\u2019s security posture and conduct simulated phishing exercises to test employee awareness.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n- Stay vigilant with emails and always verify the sender and links before interacting with them.\n- Use strong passwords, enable MFA, and keep all software up to date.\n- Backup your data regularly and encrypt sensitive information.\n- Use privacy tools like VPNs and browser extensions to protect your online activity.\n- Educate yourself and others about common threats like phishing and whaling.\n\nBy combining these practices with the right tools, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to cyberattacks."
