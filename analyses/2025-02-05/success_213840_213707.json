OTCPK ATDS, a leading data security and privacy software company, today announced operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 Recent Business Highlights No customer or contract losses due to COVID-19 conditions Staff and business operations retained and on scope Released the CCPA version of the GDPR Framework for WordPress to the public Rapidly changed business operations to adapt to new conditions due to COVID-19 emergency New Data Center online and consolidation project nearing completion Second version of Global Privacy Manager available for private beta Public shopping cart ordering platform launched  more product line being added weekly Larger SMB  B2C marketing campaigns being launched starting Q2 Financial Highlights from Q1 2020 Continued significant gross of deferred revenues to 1,032,000 234 growth in revenue growth from same reporting period last year to 478,000 Net loss mainly attributable to change in fair value of derivative liability reporting Combined SGA includes new product development, Data Center build out and sales force as well as listed items Management Commentary Jason Remillard, CEO of Data443, commented, The first quarter of 2020 reflects the combined business operations of all 5 reporting product lines. We incurred greater costs this quarter due to the extensive strategic planning and development undertaken, which included the launch of our new Data Center in the Raleigh-Durham Research Triangle Region near our headquarters. This initiative was taken to reduce our spend on the public cloud and provide our customers more options for their longer term and high capacity spend options, particularly for the ultra-high density orders we are seeing now. The build was made more complicated by challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic  with component availability issues starting in December of 2019 and lasting throughout the last 4 months. However, it is now in full operation. Outside of the Data Center build out, we continue to refine our product lines to facilitate the growing data privacy capabilities that we believe are required in todays marketplace. Even within the current pandemic, we continue to validate the pricing, fit and capability requirements for both the Global Privacy Manager product, along with the additional capabilities that are available for our product lines  Classification, Governance, Secure Document Delivery and Distribution, large scale data lake for eDiscovery and search and massive file transfer services  ad hoc and scheduled. The emergent data privacy requirements are in many cases simply good data security and compliance practices  exercised at new business and risk levels. We are bringing many of these existing capabilities to new visibility and new availability. For example, consider the problem faced by a medium size business owner who could never afford  cash or staffing wise  the ability to deploy a large-scale classification or eDiscoverydata lake capability. Today, due to our our redeployment and engineering efforts  they are able to do so in just a few mouse clicks and pay for it on a monthly or yearly basis, while also enabling not just a new security and compliance stance, but also comply with the myriad privacy laws across the US and around the world. As the California Attorney General recently reiterated  the CCPA will be enforced with rigor starting July 2020 and new modifications to the law are already slated for later this year. We fully expect more to come from California  and additional frequent and aggressive actions for different states in the next 6-18 months. The ongoing emergency with COVID-19 continues to highlight the privacy risks associated with personal information, the blurring lines between employer, government, community and data sharing and processing parties. This area of data privacy and processing will continue to see significant activity. In conclusion, the ongoing emergency has highlighted the continued need for a multi-legged approach to our business. A solid foundation of multiple products that contribute to diversified revenue streams that we already take advantage of, as well as diverse staff capabilities and infrastructure that support the overall business in different ways. Throughout the past 8 weeks, we have seen our products used in many unique ways  and our staff members jump in to support and contribute in many ways as well. I am proud of our whole team, as theyve done an incredible job, reacting swiftly and professionally in these highly evolving times. Our survival and our ability to thrive is no small feat in this climate, and I appreciate everyones support, including our loyal shareholders and service providers who continue to support us! concluded Mr. Remillard.
