Whats interesting is that even though the email themes used are varied, the attached bait documents are mostly similar. Below we have provided an example email and a step-by-step analysis of the malicious Excel Workbook attachment being utilized, along with Indicators of Compromise listed at the bottom. We have not been successful in acquiring the final payload from the malware servers, so we have no idea what the main purpose of this campaign is at this moment. We will update this blog with any new information. Example email from one of the related campaigns utilizing the Excel Workbook attachment. How It Works Payload Analysis Excel Workbook Attachment Once you open this Excel Workbook, you will see a decoy image prompting you to enable the macro content from the Office Security Options Drops embedded XLSX to the Windows temporary directory as 13.xlsx Renames XLSX file 13.xlsx.zip Extracts either carpc2.dll for 64-bit or carpc2.dll for 32-bit Windows Loads the extracted DLL with LoadLibrary API and calls the Get2 export function DLL Behaviour Once loaded, the DLL decrypts a needed function, which also decrypts and decompresses the main DLL at runtime. The 32-bit main DLL is packed with UPX unlike the 64-bit version which is not. The main DLL will then gather the following information from the affected system Computer Name User Name OS Version Currently running process names This information is then used as parameters for the beacon to its servers Depending on the servers response, it may attempt to download and execute a final payload into the affected system.

    "content": "**Analysis of Suspected BEC Campaign Targeting Banks**\n\nThe suspected Business Email Compromise (BEC) campaign involves attackers using malicious Excel files with macros to target banks. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:\n\n### Key Features and Insights:\n\n1. **Attack Mechanism**:\n   - Attackers send emails with Excel attachments containing malicious macros.\n   - Enabling macros triggers the installation of a DLL, which gathers system information and communicates with attacker servers.\n\n2. **Technical Details**:\n   - The Excel file drops and executes a malicious DLL in the temp directory.\n   - The DLL collects system information (computer name, username, OS version, running processes) and sends it to the attacker's server.\n   - The attacker may subsequently download additional payloads.\n\n3. **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:\n   - Provided hashes and URLs help identify compromised systems.\n   - Variations in email themes but similar malicious attachments indicate a coordinated campaign.\n\n4. **Detection and Prevention**:\n   - Cyren's tools detect these threats, highlighting their security capabilities, but the exact integration with email services isn't detailed.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement:\n\n1. **User-Focused Advice**:\n   - Advise users to avoid enabling macros from unknown sources.\n   - Suggest verifying email authenticity and using anti-malware tools.\n   - Recommend security awareness training for employees.\n\n2. **Compliance and Trust**:\n   - Highlight any compliance certifications (e.g., GDPR, ISO) to enhance trust.\n   - Discuss data protection measures like encryption and regular backups.\n\n3. **Enhanced Security Features**:\n   - Detail how solutions integrate with email services to block threats.\n   - Emphasize the importance of software updates and behavior monitoring.\n\n4. **Best Practices**:\n   - Encourage caution with email attachments and the use of antivirus software.\n   - Advocate for disabling macros by default unless necessary.\n\nThis analysis underscores the importance of user vigilance, robust security measures, and comprehensive solutions to mitigate BEC threats effectively.",
