As more and more companies move from hosted Exchange to Office365, this has become an increasingly common phrase. While O365 is a useful tool and has an attractive value proposition, it is recommended that organizations check their true requirements before using it as a legitimate archiving solution. Generally, the whole point of the archive capability is to provide a search and data retrieval functionality that is immutable, trustworthy, and certifiable  in most cases  in court. As adoption rates of Office 365 continue to strengthen, specifically for archiving capabilities, IT Security  Compliance teams must consider key associated risks. Office365 does not allow for journaling to itself While this might not seem like something of utmost importance, O365 lacks the basic functionality for journaling to itself. Why? The destination must be off premises from the tenant ID and must be a destination that is immutable and external from the Tenant itself. Even Microsoft doesnt trust its own repository to be immutable  it cant be  since administrators and other power users can delete, purge and otherwise manipulate messages  this doesnt pass audit requirements. Office365s eDiscovery features are incredibly limited and doesnt search on- premises datasets When search requests are executed, they are only done based on existing mailboxes, which of course would not uncover any emails previously deleted or purged, or what the spam filters deleted. In many litigation cases, organizations will need to see years worth of emails upfront. Unfortunately, O365 limits your search results to default amounts set by Microsoft  and this is not sufficient for most large-scale litigation. Journaling upline from these factors ensures that all data is captured and is legitimately available as an organization needs it. Microsoft will make recommendations to continue running Exchange to continue to journal to  if you dont have an archiving appliance or service Organizations seeking active cloud migration from on- premise will face challenges around keeping old archives. Many teams have metadata and other content that must be kept and integrated  and Office 365 does not provide this integrated capability. It is important to consider from a budgetary perspective, as third-party solutions will be required. Office365s Golden Copy Is Not Compliance Friendly The journaling process captures an email message as soon as it is sent or received, ensuring it has not been deleted or edited. This method creates a copy of record or golden copy which can be used in the eDiscovery process. In the case of O365, users have access to delete and purge mail which poses a risk throughout the journaling process, allowing for potential gaps in data consistency, handling or chain of custody. Search  Discovery is Slow Slow and steady doesnt always win the race. Organizations need their data now and they need it fast. Many undergoing audits will need access to all records in real-time and having to wait for prolonged periods will inevitably cause delays, longer audit cycles and potential increased budgetary consequences. Sometimes an eDiscovery request within the Microsoft portal can take days. The streamlined Issues of O365 Apply to Other Collaboration Platforms Teams, OneDrive, and Sharepoint, namely. All data sets are subject generally to the same discovery and retention rules. Global retention policies cannot be set across all data sets in Azure, data sets cannot be deduplicated, and organizations cannot classify, move and otherwise apply compliance actions against these same datasets in Azure. Key Takeaways Office365 should not be the end allbe all for an organizations email archiving solutions, and third- party archiving solutions, like Data443s business- ready Data Archive Manager, are a necessary addition to Office365 capabilities. Data Archive Manager, unlike Office365, provides superior indexing technology, allowing users to perform simple or highly detailed Boolean searches using full-text keywords or key phrases. In addition to eDiscovery and audit capabilities, Data Archive Manger de-duplicates all email messages, attachments, file systems, SharePoint, and social media, then compresses the data prior to storing it to an on-premise appliance, SAN, NAS, or cloud-based hosted storage solution.

    "content": "**End-User Guidance on Data Security and Protection**\n\n**1. Security Best Practices**\n\n- **Strong Passwords:** Use unique, complex passwords for all accounts. Consider using a password manager to securely store them.\n- **Enable MFA:** Turn on Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Office 365 to add an extra layer of security.\n- **Regular Updates:** Keep all software, including Office 365, updated to protect against vulnerabilities.\n- **Monitor Activity:** Regularly review account activity to detect unauthorized access early.\n\n**2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n\n- **Third-Party Archiving:** Consider solutions like Data443's Archive Manager for comprehensive archiving beyond Office 365's capabilities.\n- **Immutable Storage:** Use tools that provide immutable storage to prevent data tampering, crucial for legal and compliance needs.\n- **Regular Backups:** Ensure data is backed up regularly, using both cloud and on-premise solutions for redundancy.\n- **Data Classification:** Organize data by sensitivity to apply appropriate protection measures.\n\n**3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n\n- **User Training:** Educate users on secure email practices and the limitations of Office 365's archiving.\n- **Avoid Over-Reliance:** Don\u2019t solely depend on Office 365 for archiving; use it as part of a broader strategy.\n- **Phishing Awareness:** Train users to identify and avoid phishing attempts to protect against data breaches.\n\n**4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n\n- **Phishing Attacks:** Implement email filtering and educate users to reduce phishing risks.\n- **Data Tampering:** Use immutable storage solutions to prevent unauthorized changes.\n- **Data Loss Prevention:** Use retention policies and third-party tools to prevent accidental deletion.\n\n**5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n\n- **Access Controls:** Restrict data access to necessary personnel using Office 365's permission settings.\n- **Encryption:** Use encryption for data at rest and in transit to ensure confidentiality.\n- **Audit Logs:** Regularly review logs to monitor data access and changes.\n\n**6. When to Seek Additional Support**\n\n- **Sensitive Data:** Consult experts if handling sensitive data or in regulated industries.\n- **Compliance Needs:** Seek advice for compliance with legal requirements.\n- **Uncertainty:** If unsure about archiving or security needs, contact IT or security professionals.\n\nBy following these guidelines, users can enhance their data security and protection, ensuring a robust and compliant environment.",
