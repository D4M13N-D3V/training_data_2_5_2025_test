January 20, 2022 We live in a fully digital world, where daily communication and business correspondence is done over email. While a multitude of benefits has come from this dependence on digital communication like increased productivity and efficiency, one threat persists, and its phishing attacks. Phishing cybercrimes have grown exponentially over the past decade and they are not slowing down. From disguising oneself as someone trustworthy in an email in order to steal ones sensitive data like passwords and credit card information, to gaining access to an entire organizations network, these attacks have the potential to target thousands of people at once. So, how do we protect ourselves and our business? Thats where an anti-phishing software solution comes in. Designed with the sophisticated tactics of phishers in mind, anti-phishing solutions are increasingly becoming a priority for businesses across sectors who want to protect the valuable information of their organization and employees. 8 Preventative Measures and Best Practices Our anti-phishing software solution is highly effective in protecting your business from phishing attacks , but there should also be a set of best practices to follow so you can maximize its effectiveness. Here are a few tips that you can implement in order to achieve this. 1. Staying Updated With The Latest Phishing Techniques Cybercriminals are always trying to find more efficient ways to attack their victims. As technology advances in cybersecurity, criminals will continually update their phishing techniques. Understanding how to spot a phishing scam and staying up to date with the latest trends can help in preventing future attacks. 2. Think Twice Before You Click This may sound like the most obvious thing to do, but dont underestimate the power of thinking twice before you click. Phishing emails can contain links that claim to come from a legitimate enterprise and lead to a website made to collect your information. Never enter personal information on a website that uses a false sense of urgency or unsecured checkouts. Links and websites will also try to resemble the actual brand very closely, so pay attention to the URL structure and the flow of the webpage. If something feels off or the branding seems different, then you should exit the page immediately and not take any chances. 3. Verify a Websites Security These days, search engines favor websites that have an SSL certificate to show visitors that they are utilizing encryption. Google will actually warn you if a website isnt encrypted before proceeding. The URL should start with HTTPS and the lock symbol should be seen to the left of it. As we mentioned before, phishing techniques change all the time and its not that hard to get an SSL certificate in general. At a minimum, a website should have this and if it doesnt, thats a clear red flag. 4. Keep Your Web Browser up to Date Have you ever had to close an app multiple times because it doesnt seem to work? Later finding out that it simply needed to be updated to work flawlessly again. The same can be considered for your web browser. Every software or application will have to undergo regular updates to make sure that security isnt compromised and cybercriminals will try their best to exploit these loopholes. Its best to turn on notifications when updates are available for your most-used applications. 5. Use a Firewall A firewall adds another layer of security and acts as a buffer between the user, computer, and the intruder. A personal firewall can analyze and filter traffic for a single computer, while a network firewall can do so for an entire network, such as a businesss local area network LAN. 6. Educate Employees About Current Phishing Threats Employee education and training is a proactive approach that companies can take to defend against sophisticated attacks effectively. With proper education and training, a companys workforce can serve as the first and last line of defense against phishing scams. 7. Develop Corporate Email Policies Email policies are policies that are set by the company. These types of policies help safeguard the company from falling victim to a phishing attack. For example, discouraging emails to be sent in HTML format, not allowing attachments and hyperlinks, never asking for personal information, and always using the recipients full name. Having rules and guidelines to follow establishes accountability but also makes it easier to spot a phishing attempt when policies are broken. 8. Encourage Password Security Best Practices Phishing attacks usually aim to steal passwords to take over accounts and gain access to systems. Creating strong and unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and using SMS tokens to verify identity can make it harder for cybercriminals to access accounts. As attacks are becoming more sophisticated, companies are beefing up their security measures with biometric authentication. Now that youve learned 8 important preventative measures to take, staying vigilant may sound like a daunting task. Its always a wise idea to add another layer of security that works for you around the clock, like an anti-phishing solution.
