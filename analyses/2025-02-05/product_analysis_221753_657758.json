Common Cybersecurity Threats In todays digital world cybersecurity threats are more frequent and more sophisticated. Organizations need a robust threat intelligence strategy to combat these evolving threats. Some of the common cybersecurity threats are Malware Malicious software designed to harm or exploit an organizations systems and data. This includes viruses, worms and trojans. Phishing Social engineering attacks that trick users into revealing sensitive information or gaining unauthorized access to systems. These attacks often look like legitimate communications to deceive users. Ransomware A type of malware that encrypts an organizations data and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key. This can cause significant downtime and financial loss. DDoS Attacks Distributed Denial of Service attacks flood an organizations systems with traffic, making them unavailable to users. These attacks can take down online services and damage reputation. Zero-Day Threats Unknown or previously unknown threats that exploit vulnerabilities in an organizations systems. These threats are particularly dangerous as they can bypass traditional security controls. The Solution Using Threat Intelligence Feeds for Brand Integrity To address these challenges the company turned to advanced threat intelligence feeds as part of their brand integrity management strategy. Specifically the Threat InDepth  Malware URL Feed and the Threat InDepth  Phishing and Fraud Feed were used. Using multiple threat intelligence feeds is important to determine which threats are relevant to your organizations security needs.
