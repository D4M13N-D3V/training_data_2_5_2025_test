Do you CIO, CISO, VP InfoSec, SecArch, SecEng, etc. want to be responsible for a leak, breach or other loss  just because the data was not classified, or was classified incorrectly? Even after spending hundreds of thousands  or millions, on peremeter security tools? Solid Data Classification  grounded in REAL business terminology, validated by data leaders in your organization is the only way to make DLP, DRM, FireWall, CASB to name a few effectual and accurate. Otherwise, all of those tools are just relying on oldinaccuratenon-existent data policies. Some security vendors are waking up to this finally  I think this is the third or fourth Classification Vendor takeout in a year flat?
