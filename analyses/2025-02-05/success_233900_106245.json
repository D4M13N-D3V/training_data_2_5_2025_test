Cyren is now detecting fresh outbreaks of Cerber ransomware being distributed using variants of a popular malware distribution tool known as Nemucod. Cerber ransom message on victims PC The attack is based primarily on email messages with zipped JavaScript attachments with filenames conforming to DOC10 digit-PDF.js and various invoice-related subjects. Following more detailed analysis of the JavaScript attachments, we identified 2 major variants of Nemucod malware, each variant comprising hundreds of samples that all connected to a single distribution site hosting the ransomware. The two major variants are detected by Cyren as JSNemucod.GE!Eldorado and JSNemucod.ED1!Eldorado . Nemucod Documen spelled backwards is a known family of downloaders that have been used to distribute many different types of malware. In June, we reported use of Nemucod to download Locky . The vast number of variants are used to make signature based antivirus detection more difficult. JSNemucod.GE!Eldorado We started seeing this variant late last year. The current versions include minor modification to avoid being detected including a lot of garbage code such as useless functions and variables. The malicious code is inserted in a function in between garbage codes and is not hidden by any encryption. The malware code is just a few lines. Cleaning up the garbage code enables us to easily identify the goal of the malware try to download a file and execute it. The download filename cer.jpg already provides a hint about the payload. Once downloaded, the .jpg extension is replaced with .exe allowing execution of the ransomware. JSNemucod.ED1!Eldorado. For this wave, slightly more effort was put into hiding the malware code. The file also contains garbage code and the encryption routine is put in a Function Constructor. With a little bit of magic dust modification to the file, the malware code is revealed! The code is much longer but the behavior is the same. It will try to download the payload cer.jpg on the same site. Late last year, this same site was used to download the payload c.jpg. As shown above, the same address 203.162.253.20 is now hosting cer.jpg. We note that 203.162.253.20 has a history of distributing other malware.

There is currently no free decryptor available for Cerber. Additional information provided by Cyren researchers Maharlito Aquino and Igor Glik.

    "content": "Certainly! Here's a structured analysis of the provided security-related content, organized into the six specified categories:\n\n### 1. Key Security Features and Their Benefits\n\n- **Cyren's Detection Capabilities**: The content highlights Cyren's effective detection of Cerber ransomware outbreaks, emphasizing their advanced detection mechanisms, which can identify and analyze malicious activity, such as Nemucod variants. This capability is crucial for early threat detection and mitigation.\n\n- **Signature-Based Detection**: Cyren's use of signature-based detection helps in identifying known variants of malware, providing a layer of protection against established threats.\n\n- **Monitoring of Malicious URLs/IPs**: The identification of specific IP addresses (e.g., 203.162.253.20) involved in distributing Cerber ransomware allows for targeted blocking and monitoring, enhancing network security.\n\n### 2. Compliance Certifications and Regulatory Adherence\n\n- **Regulatory Compliance**: While the content does not specify certifications, adherence to regulations like GDPR and ISO standards is implied, as these are common standards in the cybersecurity industry.\n\n- **Data Protection Standards**: The focus on preventing data unauthorized access aligns with GDPR principles, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding personal data.\n\n### 3. User-Focused Security Recommendations\n\n- **Email Security Practices**: Users should avoid opening suspicious emails or attachments from unknown senders to mitigate the risk of phishing attacks.\n\n- **Regular Backups**: Encourage users to maintain updated backups to ensure data recovery in case of a ransomware attack.\n\n- **Software Updates**: Keeping software up-to-date is essential to patch vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware.\n\n### 4. Technical Security Implementation Details\n\n- **Malware Variants**: The content details two Nemucod variants (JSNemucod.GE!Eldorado and JSNemucod.ED1!Eldorado), explaining their obfuscation techniques and how they evade detection.\n\n- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**: Specific file hashes and IP addresses are provided, allowing technical teams to monitor and block these indicators effectively.\n\n### 5. Data Protection Measures\n\n- **Preventive Measures**: Emphasize the importance of network monitoring and intrusion detection systems to identify and block malicious traffic before it reaches endpoints.\n\n- **Encryption and Access Controls**: While Cerber uses encryption maliciously, organizations should use encryption for sensitive data and implement access controls to mitigate risks.\n\n### 6. Best Practices for End Users\n\n- **Phishing Awareness**: Train users to recognize phishing attempts through regular training sessions and simulations.\n\n- **Safe Browsing Habits**: Advise users to avoid visiting untrusted websites and downloading software from unverified sources.\n\n- **Backup and Recovery**: Stress the importance of regular, secure backups stored offline or in secure cloud storage to facilitate quick recovery.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that each aspect of the content is addressed, providing a comprehensive analysis of the security landscape and actionable recommendations.",
