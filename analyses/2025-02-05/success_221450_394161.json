Threat actors can easily scrape the internet, in other words, specific data is very easily gathered and copied from the web . This makes company emails a very easy target, as they are available in their websites, especially the emails for their purchasing department, as can be seen in the email sample below. Figure 1.0 Email Sample This phishing email attachment is an excel file Sales Receipt. Opening the file will prompt you to enable macros, but if we try to view the macro code, the option for Edit is grayed out. Default is disabled. Figure 2.0 You are unable to view the macro code using MS Visual Basic Editor as the project is locked. Figure 3.0 How can the macro code be checked? In order for us to check the macro code and its properties, we can use Olevba tool. Below is the dump of the macro code and the file properties. The Excel 4.0 macro sheet and Sheet2 were set to hidden, and that is the reason why we couldnt view the macro code and the worksheet named Sheet2. In order for us to view the code in the Visual Basic editor, we can use the Evil Clippy tool to unhide the macro code. Figure 3.1 Dumped macro code Figure 3.2 File properties Once we use the tool to unhide the macro, we can now use the Visual Basic editor. Since we know that it also has a hidden worksheet, we can insert the code Sheets2.Visible  True to reveal it. We can also write a file to dump the data that it will use. Figure 4.0 Opened document with Sheet2 revealed using the inserted code When analyzing the macro code, it tries to retrieve data from 2 cells. One from the main sheet, and one from the hidden sheet. It will try to use this set of data to decrypt strings that it will use later. The function Prv_orders is the one that will decrypt the strings. It will take 1 byte of data from each cell, and it will add the ascii value of the byte in Sheet1, and the numerical value of the byte in Sheet2. Then it will convert it into a character that corresponds to the value added. Looping until all data is decrypted. Figure 5.1 Encrypted data in Sheet1 Figure 5.2 The first part of the decrypted string is a set of URLs that it will use to download the payload. The 2 nd part which is delimited with the string HHHH is a code that uses Excel 4.0 Macro functions. Figure 6.0 Download URL which is delimited with D, and the highlighted part is the code using macro functions which is delimited with  The Excel 4.0 Macro code works in combination with the Main macro code. The main code will execute the Excel 4.0 Macro code using the Run function. Using a loop, the main macro code will insert the Excel 4.0 Macro code to a cell one at a time, and then execute it using the Run function.

    "content": "**Analysis of a Dridex Phishing Campaign Using Malicious Excel Files**\n\n**1. Security Features**\n- **Tools Utilized**: Olevba and Evil Clippy were used to analyze and unhide macro code, demonstrating the importance of advanced tools in detecting hidden threats. These tools highlight the need for robust antivirus software with macro scanning capabilities for users.\n- **Importance of Macro Policies**: Organizations should implement policies to restrict macro execution from untrusted sources, enhancing security against similar attacks.\n\n**2. Compliance and Regulatory Adherence**\n- **Standards to Adhere to**: Companies should comply with GDPR, ISO 27001, and NIST guidelines to ensure data protection and privacy.\n- **Compliance Actions**: Regular security audits, employee training, and incident response plans are crucial for maintaining compliance and preparedness.\n\n**3. User-Focused Security Recommendations**\n- **User Education**: Training users to recognize phishing attempts and the risks of enabling macros is essential. Simulating phishing attacks can enhance awareness.\n- **Organizational Measures**: Implementing email filters and restricting macros can prevent such attacks. Ensuring software updates and using antivirus solutions are vital.\n\n**4. Technical Security Implementation Details**\n- **Excel 4.0 Macros**: These macros are concerning as they are often trusted due to their age, making them a stealthy attack vector. Hidden sheets and locked code are anti-analysis techniques used by attackers.\n- **Encryption Method**: The simple byte addition method, while not advanced, underscores the importance of vigilance and robust security measures.\n\n**5. Data Protection Measures**\n- **Email Security**: Encrypting sensitive emails and controlling access to email directories can prevent scraping.\n- **Endpoint Solutions**: Deploying antivirus and EDR solutions, along with regular backups, can mitigate ransomware impacts.\n\n**6. Best Practices for End Users**\n- **Email Verification**: Users should verify senders, especially for financial requests, and avoid enabling macros from unknown sources.\n- **Proactive Measures**: Reporting suspicious emails, updating software, using strong passwords, and monitoring accounts are crucial for security.\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive overview, ensuring each section is tailored to both technical and non-technical users, emphasizing actionable advice and clear explanations.",
