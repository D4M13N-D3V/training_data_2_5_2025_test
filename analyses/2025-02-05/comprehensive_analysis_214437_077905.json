As the number of sent and received emails has increased to around 300 billion in 2020 so have the number of opportunities for scammers. Business email compromise BEC is an attempt to impersonate someone to illegally take over the victims finances. A BEC attack excludes phishing URLs and malicious files in the attachment. This specific attack is based on social engineering skills, making it hard for the security engines to detect the email once it arrives into the victims mailbox.

As a general rule, attackers target the person which deals with or indirectly relates to the organizations finances, or has access to corporate banking accounts, etc. It is easy to understand that such an attack requires careful preparation. The criminal must have detailed knowledge of the recipient and the impersonated sender  the trust relationships, their habits and personal qualities.

Low Volume, High Impact According to Cyren Inbox Security statistics, the average percentage of BEC emails is around 2 out of total malicious emails.

In such a case the scammer might use the name, email address, or corporate domain of the impersonated person to mislead the victim. It is especially effective when the senders address is hidden, and only the name is displayed on the recipient side, as if often the case when reading email on a mobile device.
