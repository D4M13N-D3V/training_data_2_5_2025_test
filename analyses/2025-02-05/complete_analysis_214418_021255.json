Continued product offerings for the consumer marketplace, which presents significant growth opportunities. Available for on-premises and via Cloud SaaS Deployments Jason Remillard, Founder and CEO of Data443 commented, The effects of the SolarWinds hack, Colonial Pipeline attack, JBS Food processor shutdown and CNA insurance attack  to only mention a very select few  continue to demonstrate an ongoing and pervasive threat to all nations and all citizens in high-risk scenarios. This is no longer a game played by script kiddies  these attacks are malicious, callous, and highly damaging. Just last Friday, I received an urgent call from a partner, who in turn had received an even more urgent call from a large power generation organization based in the US. Due to the new CISA guidance as directed by the White House, this organization had to both report on its current cyber response state AND have a full remediation plan in place  regardless of cost  by this Thursday. Similar scenarios are playing out daily across America  and wont be for just pipeline and nuclear power providers. This will be for banks, hospitals, state and local government  anywhere there is a risk to life, freedom, or financial resources, continued Mr. Remillard. Theft, extortion, leakage of employee and customer data, and mass downtime are some of the most damaging activities that can be subjected to any organization. Indeed, some do not even survive. Our mission has always been to discover, categorize and protect all data. Centurion fits perfectly into our mission. Combined with our existing commercial offerings, there is a great fit with our open-source community organizations which are both commercial over 8,000 now and pure open-source over 450,000.

The Data443 team has all of the extra capabilities weve been looking for in a partner and ultimately  an acquirer. Fantastic product line, excellent execution in the marketplace, and a storyline that matches up with customer needs. We are excited to be a part of this story and look forward to the future! commented Tripp Manheimer, President of Centurion Technologies. The transaction will complete the terms of an OEM agreement with Centurion executed in early 2021. Closing is subject to due diligence and traditional closing conditions. Anticipated closing will be immediately after the major market uplist. About Data443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. Data443 Risk Mitigation, Inc.
