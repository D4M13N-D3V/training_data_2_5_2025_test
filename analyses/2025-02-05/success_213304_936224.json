    "content": "**Security Guidance for End-Users**\n\n1. **Authentication**\n   - Use strong passwords and enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to add an extra security layer beyond just a password.\n\n2. **Data Classification**\n   - Classify data based on sensitivity. Handle sensitive data (e.g., financial records, personal information) with enhanced security measures.\n\n3. **Encryption**\n   - Encrypt data both at rest and in transit using secure protocols like HTTPS. Prioritize encryption for sensitive data.\n\n4. **Access Control**\n   - Ensure users only have necessary access rights. Regularly audit and update access permissions to reflect current roles.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Alerting**\n   - Use automated tools to monitor data transfers and set alerts for unusual activities, such as large file transfers or repeated access attempts.\n\n6. **Compliance**\n   - Stay informed about regulations like HIPAA and ensure data handling practices comply with these standards. Consider training or resources for updates.\n\n7. **Secure Data Transfer**\n   - Use managed file transfer tools instead of email or FTP for transferring sensitive data. Understand that email may not be secure for sensitive information.\n\n8. **Data Backup and Caution**\n   - Backup data before transferring. Be cautious of unsolicited emails requesting data transfers to avoid phishing incidents.\n\n9. **Network Security**\n   - Ensure firewalls and antivirus software are enabled. Keep all software updated to patch security vulnerabilities.\n\n10. **Training and Awareness**\n    - Participate in regular security training. Educate yourself on phishing, password security, and safe data handling practices. Report suspicious activities promptly.\n\n11. **Seek Support When Needed**\n    - Consult IT/security teams when unsure about handling sensitive data or if you encounter security concerns.\n\n12. **Incident Response**\n    - Be prepared with an incident response plan to quickly address and minimize the impact of security breaches.\n\nBy following these practical steps, you can enhance data security and reduce risks effectively.",
