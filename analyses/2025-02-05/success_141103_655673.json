Verify the sender if unsure.\n- **Ransomware:** Back up regularly and avoid opening risky downloads to prevent encryption attacks.\n- **Insider Threats:** Trust colleagues but monitor access. Prevent data theft by distracted or malicious insiders.\n- **Third-Party Breaches:** Vet service providers for security practices and compliant certifications.\n- **Physical Theft:** Keep devices secure and consider tracking software for lost or stolen laptops.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n\n- **Data Transparency:** Clearly communicate how you use personal information to build trust.\n- **Access Control:** Limit data access to necessary individuals to reduce exposure risk.\n- **Data Minimization:** Collect only essential data to minimize potential breaches.\n- **Secure Disposal:** Erase sensitive data securely before disposal, including physical devices.\n\n---\n\n### **6.
