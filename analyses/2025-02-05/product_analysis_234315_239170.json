We previously reported our detection of key changes in Lockys methods on June 27  new sandbox evasion techniques , July 4  new downloading technique , July 14  attachment format change , and most recently July 21  embedded in JavaScript   the criminal syndicate behind Locky is evidently quite busy, and quite resourceful. The email being sent in this latest wave, as often before, uses business finance-related topics to lure users into opening its attachment, which is ZIP-archived JavaScript. Comparing this variant to the earlier variants, it has added another layer of obfuscation which decrypts and executes the real Locky downloader script. A quick de-obfuscation shows a similar structure to the previous Locky downloader scripts. The download behavior is similar to that seen before, as the files downloaded from the URLs inserted in the script are decrypted and dropped in the Windows Temp directory. What we find most interesting in this latest Locky wave is that instead of downloading an EXE binary, this ransomware component now comes as a DLL binary. Cyren detects this variant as W32Locky.AT_1.gen!Eldorado. The DLL is loaded using rundll32.exe with the following command line syntax Upon closer inspection, the DLL is using a custom packer to prevent anti-malware scanners from easily detecting it. Upon successful execution, the loaded DLL does its usual ransomware routine to find and encrypt files in the affected system, before dropping and displaying the ransom payment instruction pages. Files encrypted by this variant are appended with .zepto as their file extension. Clicking on the onion link directs the user to the same Locky Decryptor page we have seen in previous Locky waves.
