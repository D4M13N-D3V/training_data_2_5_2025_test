The proliferation of exploit kits and self-service ransomware offerings is allowing even unsophisticated, untrained would-be hackers to get into the ransomware business. In 2017 total ransomware payments globally are expected to surpass 2 billion, double the rate of 2016, with other indirect costs downtime, lost productivity, reputational harm, et al. expected to exceed 5 billion.

It is used to distribute spam and malware, or launch distributed denial- of-service attacks. Botnets can be comprised of as many as 500,000 to 1,000,000 devices, and send up to 60 billion spam emails in a day. The term botnet derives from the combination of the words roBOT NETwork.

Advertisements are often appear as pop-ups in windows that the user is unable to close. Sometimes adware is designed with multiple objectives. For example, in addition to advertising, adware may include spyware that observes the users computing activities without his knowledge or the adware may include stolen certificates that deactivate the systems antivirus or antimalware protection.

Because the networks and websites on which malvertising appears are often highly legitimate, victims are easily duped since they do not have to click an email link or visit a compromised website. Clicking on a malicious piece of advertising is not always required, as systems can become infected both pre-click and post-click. 10Clone Phishing A phishing attack in which the phisher uses a genuine, previously delivered email to create an identical or almost identical email containing similar content, attachment, recipient, and sender email address. A fraudulent link or attachment replaces the original one. Because the email appears to come from a legitimate source, this spoofed email is used to gain trust with the victim.
