      "user_guidance": "### Practical Security Guidance for Data Protection and Privacy\n\n#### 1. **Security Best Practices**\n   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA for all sensitive accounts to add an extra layer of security beyond just a password.\n   - **Strong Passwords:** Use unique, complex passwords for every account. Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate passwords.\n   - **Data Classification:** Regularly classify and categorize sensitive data to ensure proper handling and protection. Use automated tools like Data Identification Manager to streamline this process.\n   - **Regular Updates:** Keep software, operating systems, and applications up to date to protect against vulnerabilities.\n\n#### 2. **Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Use tools with built-in encryption and DLP (Data Loss Prevention) controls.\n   - **Backup Data:** Regularly back up critical data to a secure, encrypted location. Test backups periodically to ensure recoverability.\n   - **Access Control:** Implement Zero Trust principles. Restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles and ensure all access is authenticated.\n   - **Safe Data Migration:** When transferring data between platforms or organizations, use secure methods like Managed File Transfer (MFT) systems.\n\n#### 3. **Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Be Cautious with Emails:** Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources to prevent phishing and malware attacks.\n   - **Verify Requests:** Always verify the authenticity of requests for sensitive information, especially via email or phone.\n   - **Public Wi-Fi:** Avoid using public Wi-Fi for accessing or transferring sensitive data.
