To give a sense of timing, you can see in this chart the samples detected by Cyren per day during the month of January for the first Emotet variant, Downldr.IE.gen, which appeared in greater volume. What is Emotet Malware? Emotet malware is a type of trojan primarily spread through email spam that persuades users to click on a malicious link or file by using persuasive language in the copy of the email. The malware then enters the users system with the goal of stealing banking and financial credentials. A Brief History of Emotet Emotet was first identified in 2014 and was used with the intention of stealing bank account information. By 2015, a new version of Emotet appeared with new modifications to keep malware under the detection radar and target Swiss banks. Fast forward a few years, and in 2018 Emotet now had the ability to install other ransomware and trojans to infected machines. After going quiet for a short period, 2019 saw Emotet come back with a new campaign targeting German, Polish, Italian, and English victims with malicious emails containing subject lines like Overdue Invoice and Payment Remittance in order to get into their network and infect their system. Today, Emotet malware continues to pose a huge threat to the security of email recipients. How Does Emotet Spread? The most common way Emotet spreads is through malspam where Emotet hijacks a users contact list and sends itself to friends, family, and coworkers. Your contact list receives an email that they feel inclined to open since its coming from someone they know, they click on a malicious URL, and Emotet downloads infected files. Additionally, Emotet can spread using a list of common passwords to compromise someones system using bruteforce or password spraying attacks. Who Does Emotet Target? Unfortunately, no one is immune to an attack from Emotet. Since it first hit the scene in 2014, Emotet has targeted individuals, companies, and government entities throughout the United States and European Union. Breaking Down the Emotet Malware Variants Variants of the Emotet malware are continuing to present themselves. Here is a breakdown of the variants we know so far and how to detect them. 1st Emotet Variant Eldorado Malware This first variant Cyren detects as PP97MDownldr.IE.gen!Eldorado. It appeared in very small volumes during January, suggesting it was just being initially tested. This is what the email attachment looks like that delivers Emotet onto the users system when the macro runs The macro retrieves the text in the Form properties, in this case the Tag. A large amount of text, 10660 bytes, is retrieved. They get the malicious code from the string content, a combination of reverse, split,  join methods were used. The outcome is a PowerShell command line with its script encoded. Decoding the script reveals a downloader code.

Here is an analysis of a sample that uses WScript Shell to execute the downloaded payload. The attachment to this variant also presents a Word document with the same text as the first sample. But here, opening the file and enabling the macro, we can see that there is a comment in the actual file. This comment is the malicious script retrieved by the macro. The toP argument is the random filename which has a .jse extension, where it will copy the contents. The file is dropped in the APPDATA folder and executed. The dropped .jse file is obfuscated. It also has anti -debugging and anti-console-logging features. This sample is similar to variants spotted last year. The b function is responsible for decrypting the strings. Here are some of the strings it will try to decrypt. It includes some of the URLs it will use to download the payload. This part of the function hooks into the console logging. It monitors for the different types of console logs and returns a call to an empty function. Anti-debugging Emotet malware For any analysts that attempt to debug the script using the developer tools on browsers like Chrome, be aware the script has a function to make it a little bit difficult to analyze. Here we can see that it tries to make a call to the gG function. Once initialized, the value of aS will be the function h9. Below is an excerpt of the code for the gG function that shows a scenario in what could happen if debugging the script in chrome. The h9 function is part of it. We remove some parts of the code just to show the scenario when h90 is called when debugging in chrome. It will execute an anonymous function to call the debugger. And create a loop with h9ha . So it will loop calling the debugger.

  "analysis": "To effectively protect against Emotet malware and enhance your overall security, follow this organized plan based on your thought process:\n\n### 1. Email Caution and Verification\n- **Verify Legitimacy**: When receiving emails with urgent requests, contact the sender via a different method (call or text) to confirm authenticity before interacting with links or attachments.\n- **Spot Phishing Attempts**: Look for spelling mistakes, generic greetings, and suspicious senders. Hover over links to check the URL before clicking.\n\n### 2. Macro Management\n- **Avoid Enabling Macros from Unknown Sources**: Refrain from enabling macros in documents from unfamiliar senders. If necessary, ask the sender to confirm the macro's purpose and safety.\n\n### 3. Password Management\n- **Use a Password Manager**: Choose a reputable password manager (e.g., LastPass, 1Password) to generate and store unique, strong passwords for each account. This helps in remembering complex passwords and reduces reuse.\n\n### 4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\n- **Implement MFA**: Enable MFA wherever possible, especially for critical accounts. Prefer authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator) over SMS due to higher security.\n\n### 5. Software Updates\n- **Regular Updates**: Enable automatic updates for your operating system and software to patch vulnerabilities promptly. Test updates in a non-critical environment if possible.\n\n### 6. Data Backup\n- **Backup Strategy**: Implement a 3-2-1 backup strategy (three copies, two different media, one offsite). Use external drives and cloud storage, ensuring backups are encrypted and regularly tested.\n\n### 7. Antivirus and Anti-Malware Tools\n- **Advanced Protection**: Consider using comprehensive security suites that include anti-malware, antivirus, and phishing protection. Examples include Norton, McAfee, or specialized tools like Malwarebytes.\n\n### 8. Network Segmentation\n- **Secure Network Setup**: Create a guest network for IoT devices and visitors. Use a router with built-in security features or consult a professional to segment your network effectively.\n\n### 9. User Education\n- **Self-Education**: Stay informed about the latest threats and security practices. If part of an organization, advocate for regular security training sessions.\n\n### 10. Anomaly Monitoring\n- **System Monitoring**: Use tools like Task Manager or third-party monitoring software to track system performance. Set up alerts for unusual activities (e.g., unexpected login attempts).\n\n### 11. Disable Unnecessary Features\n- **Reduce Attack Surface**: Review application features and disable those not in use. For critical software, consult documentation or support to ensure safe disabling.\n\n### 12. Secure Network Connections\n- **Use a VPN**: Choose a reputable VPN (e.g., NordVPN, ExpressVPN) for public Wi-Fi connections to encrypt your data and protect privacy.\n\n### 13. Security Audits\n- **DIY and Professional Tools**: Use free tools like Nessus for vulnerability scans. For deeper audits, consider hiring a cybersecurity expert or using managed security services.\n\n### 14. Incident Response Plan\n- **Response Strategy**: Develop a basic plan including steps like isolating infected devices, changing passwords, and notifying stakeholders. Include contact information for professional help.\n\n### 15. Seeking Professional Help\n- **Expert Assistance**: If you suspect an infection, disconnect from the internet, do not restart, and contact a cybersecurity professional to avoid exacerbating the issue.\n\n### Summary\nStart with simpler steps like MFA, backups, and email vigilance. Gradually implement more advanced measures like network segmentation and audits. Continuous learning and adapting to new threats will enhance your defense against Emotet and other malware."
