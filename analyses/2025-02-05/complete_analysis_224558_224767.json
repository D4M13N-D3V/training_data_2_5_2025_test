Also enormous? The 78 of Microsoft 365 administrators who reported successful security breaches, citing email phishing as the leading cause. Cloud inboxes are simply more vulnerable than on-premises email platforms. But enterprises using Microsoft 365 consistently report higher levels of successful phishing attacks. Related Secure Email Gateways Cost 3B Last Year  Phishing Attacks Are Still Evading Them Why Microsoft 365? What makes Microsoft 365 uniquely vulnerable to phishing and scams? Its native security has a 16 false negative rate for spam and phishing emails, according to Mimecast. If a scammer uses a spoofedlookalikesoundalike domain that doesnt exactly match your domain name, Microsoft 365 wont flag the activity. It also wont flag spoofed domains for your business partners or even well-known brands. Saleforce.com will still go through. Microsoft 365 uses static blacklists when scanning URLs for threats. Meanwhile phishing sites can have short life spans, even just a few hours. Analyzing each site in real time is a far stronger form of prevention. And Microsoft 365 has features such as Safe Attachments , which uses virtual sandboxing to scan attachments in an email. But sophisticated threats require deeper inspection of embedded documents and code. A Workaround If youre otherwise happy with Microsoft 365, explore an inner layer of email security called Inbox Detection and Response IDR. While the trusty Secure Email Gateway filters spam and known threats, it cant detect sophisticated email attacks, like account takeovers, phishing, spearphishing, and Business Email Compromise BEC. IDR solutions hook into cloud inboxes, continuously scan all inbound and outbound emails in all folders, and follow links. They check URLs favicons, logos, site maps, domain owners, and security certificates  all indicators that help flag, Is this a valid email or a threat? When threats are uncovered, IDR solutions can also automatically delete every copy across every mailbox. Automatic remediation massively reduces the window of vulnerability caused by malicious emails lingering for lengthy periods within the reach of users. Enter Cyren Inbox Security Cyren Inbox Security was built to safeguard each and every Microsoft 365 mailbox in your organization. It is a continuous and automated layer of security right in the user mailbox Persistently rescans inbound, outbound and delivered emails in all folders Reduces investigative overhead with automated incident and case management workflows A seamless mailbox plugin lets users scan and report suspicious emails Our threat visibility is unsurpassed.
