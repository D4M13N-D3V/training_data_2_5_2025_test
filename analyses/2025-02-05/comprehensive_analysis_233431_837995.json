Jaff Ransomware Launched from Necurs Botnet May 15, 2017 Despite WannaCrypt grabbing all the headlines, it is far from being the only ransomware in circulation. A second wave of Jaff ransomware is now being distributed by the stealthy Necurs botnet. Starting on Monday, May 8 around 930 UTC, the Necurs botnet was harnessed to distribute a new Locky-style email campaign with an initial global outbreak of around 20 million emails. Cyren saw and blocked about 50 million Jaff emails in less than 24 hours during a subsequent wave, and on Thursday approximately 65 million Jaff emails were detected and blocked. Locky Redux? There are signs that the same group responsible for Locky and Dridex are also at work here. Because of Necurs size and stealth, we predict that this attack campaign will be persistent and large-scale. Initial Locky distributions in Q1 2016 were about one-tenth the size of the later massive Locky outbreaks seen in Q4 2016  if this pattern holds true, and this is a merely timid beginning by Jaff, future volumes will be enormous. What is the difference between WannaCrypt and Jaff? In both WannaCrypt and Jaff the criminal motives are the same, extorting victims for money by holding files for ransom. However, while keeping your operating system up-to-date with the latest security patches may get you out of being infected by WannaCrypt, there is no guarantee of such protection in most ransomware campaigns. The vulnerability Jaff exploits is the human factor, and user action is always required for the attack to work. Compared to other ransomware campaigns, Jaff is asking an unusually high ransom payment, approximately 3,800 per infection. The highly profiled WannaCrypt asks for 300, increasing to 600 if the ransom has not been paid after a week. How does Jaff work? Jaff is distributed with an email campaign sent from the Necurs botnet. Typically, such emails contain a message body designed to trick the user into opening the attachment, but here Jaff differs. The email contains only an attachment and the message body is either blank or just has the name of the attachment  we assume to make users curious enough to simply open the attachment. In the first attack, the emails had names like Document_random number.pdf and Scan_random number.pdf. Subsequent outbreaks mainly used attachment names with only numbers. The attached PDF has an embedded docm file  a document file containing a macro. Depending on the version of Adobe, the document will either prompt the user to open the embedded doc, or it will automatically launch MS Word. Once opened, the user is prompted to enable editing and content. Hyper-Evasive Tactics Varied in Every Wave to Evade Detection The attackers vary all parts of the attack during each wave to make detection of the emails and various files more complex The names of the files and the email subjects are randomly changed The order of actions taken by the pdf script is changed The Word macro that constructs the download link and downloads the file is different in each variant The download links are changed Macro Downloads Ransomware After being enabled, the macro downloads the Jaff ransomware executable file from one of a list of hardcoded URLs as seen in the picture below, in this specific case djkammerthal.dehHGFjd. The downloaded binary is decrypted by the macro, installed and executed. First, the program connects to a CC server to let the attackers know of a new infection.  ... method GET, host h552terriddows.com, uri a5, ... status_code 201, status_msg Created,  Excerpt from the CC check-in. File Formats Encrypted After check-in, the encryption of files on the victim computer starts. Encryption using RSA-2048 key AES CBC 256-bit encryption algorithm is used and a .jaff extension is appended to the encrypted files. The following file formats are encrypted xlsx .acd .pdf .pfx .crt .der .cad .dwg .MPEG .rar .veg .zip .txt .jpg .doc .wbk .mdb .vcf .docx .ics .vsc .mdf .dsr .mdi .msg .xls .ppt .pps .obd .mpd .dot .xlt .pot .obt .htm .html .mix .pub .vsd .png .ico .rtf .odt .3dm .3ds .dxf .max .obj .7z .cbr .deb .gz .rpm .sitx .tar .tar.gz .zipx .aif .iff .m3u .m4a .mid .key .vib .stl .psd .ova .xmod .wda .prn .zpf .swm .xml .xlsm .par .tib .waw .001 .002 .003 .004 .005 .006 .007 .008 .009 .010 .contact .dbx .jnt .mapimail .oab .ods .ppsm .pptm .prf .pst .wab .1cd .3g2 .7ZIP .accdb .aoi .asf .asp. aspx .asx .avi .bak .cer .cfg .class .config .css .csv .db .dds .fif .flv .idx .js .kwm .laccdb .idf .lit .mbx .md .mlb .mov .mp3 .mp4 .mpg .pages .php .pwm .rm .safe .sav .save .sql .srt .swf .thm .vob .wav .wma .wmv .xlsb .aac .ai .arw .c .cdr .cls .cpi .cpp .cs .db3 .docm .dotm .dotx .drw .dxb .eps .fla .flac .fxg .java .m .m4v .pcd .pct .pl .potm .potx .ppam .ppsx .ps .pspimage .r3d .rw2 .sldm .sldx .svg .tga .wps .xla .xlam .xlm .xltm .xltx .xlw .act .adp .al .bkp .blend .cdf .cdx .cgm .cr2 .dac .dbf .dcr .ddd .design .dtd .fdb .fff .fpx .h .iif .indd .jpeg .mos .nd .nsd .nsf .nsg .nsh .odc .odp .oil .pas .pat .pef .ptx .qbb .qbm .sas7bdat .say .st4 .st6 .stc .sxc .sxw .tlg .wad .xlk .aiff .bin .bmp .cmt .dat .dit .edb .flvv .gif .groups .hdd .hpp .log .m2ts .m4p .mkv .ndf .nvram .ogg .ost .pab .pdb .pif .qed .qcow .qcow2 .rvt .st7 .stm .vbox .vdi .vhd .vhdx .vmdk .vmsd .vmx .vmxf .3fr .3pr .ab4 .accde .accdt .ach .acr .adb .srw .st5 .st8 .std .sti .stw .stx .sxd .sxg .sxi .sxm .tex .wallet .wb2 .wpd .x11 .x3f .xis .ycbcra .qbw .qbx .qby .raf .rat .raw .rdb rwl .rwz .s3db .sd0 .sda .sdf .sqlite .sqlite3 .sqlitedb .sr .srf .oth .otp .ots .ott .p12 .p7b .p7c .pdd .pem .plus_muhd .plc .pptx .psafe3 .py .qba .qbr.myd .ndd .nef .nk .nop .nrw .ns2 .ns3 .ns4 .nwb .nx2 .nxl .nyf .odb .odf .odg .odm .ord .otg .ibz .iiq .incpas .jpe .kc2 .kdbx .kdc .kpdx .lua .mdc .mef .mfw .mmw .mny .moneywell .mrw.des .dgc .djvu .dng .drf .dxg .eml .erbsql .erd .exf .ffd .fh .fhd .gray .grey .gry .hbk .ibank .ibd .cdr4 .cdr5 .cdr6 .cdrw .ce1 .ce2 .cib .craw .crw .csh .csl .db_journal .dc2 .dcs .ddoc .ddrw .ads .agdl .ait .apj .asm .awg .back .backup .backupdb .bank .bay .bdb .bgt .bik .bpw .cdr3 .as4 The picture above shows a folder after encryption of files.
