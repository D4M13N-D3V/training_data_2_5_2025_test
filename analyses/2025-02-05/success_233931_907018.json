At the core of this new release is functionality that we are calling contextual access control . We believe that to securely share data and connect organizations we need to go beyond todays narrow definition of identity to a broader understanding, one that is focused on context. Organizations today are in a tricky spot. They fully acknowledge that the world has become digital, and that to be competitive they must connect and collaborate with outside parties. On the other hand, sharing resources with partners and customers is inherently risky. Many still feel that the security concerns outweigh the benefits. Others use Identity and Access Management IAM systems that were built for internal sharing, and use identity, provisioned by a single entity as the root of trust. Going beyond identity to focus on context however, allows us to reimagine IAM for the connected world. Contextual access control offers a way for organizations to gather enough context to form a more complete picture of these external parties. Fundamentally, the more you know about the context of an access request the more likely you are to make the correct access decision. Contextual access is about connecting to data sources so that we can answer sophisticated questions before granting access. These questions fall into the following categories Subject  What are the details about the person requesting access? Role, group memberships, department, company, certifications, biometrics etc. Action  What is the person attempting to do? Read, write, edit, download etc. Resource  What resource will be impacted by the action? Apps, docs, APIs, services etc. Environment  What is the environment of the request? Time, location, device type etc. Broadening the definition of what we mean by identity allows us to ask and answer questions like Is this a doctor? or Is this a trusted device? Interestingly we are seeing a number of industry experts who are also talking about context in the same breath as identity. For example, in a recent article Forresters VP and Principal Analyst, Andras Cser,  acser  defined identity as follows By identity, we mean a specific set of attributes that, when paired with the right context, and policy evaluation engine, allows the user to connect and access only the company data and apps that they are supposed to have access to.

    "content": "### Analysis of Resilient Access 3.0's Contextual Access Control\n\n#### 1. Key Security Features and Their Benefits\n- **Contextual Access Control**: This feature enhances security by considering multiple factors beyond just identity, such as the subject, action, resource, and environment. This leads to more accurate access decisions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\n- **Multi-Faceted Context Evaluation**: By evaluating context from various dimensions, the system ensures that access is granted based on a comprehensive understanding of the request, thereby improving security precision.\n\n#### 2. Compliance Certifications and Regulatory Adherence\n- While specific certifications aren't mentioned, Resilient Access 3.0's focus on detailed access control aligns with regulatory requirements that emphasize robust security practices. Further details would be needed to confirm compliance with standards like GDPR or HIPAA.\n\n#### 3. User-Focused Security Recommendations\n- **Regular Access Reviews**: Users should periodically review and update their access permissions to ensure they remain appropriate.\n- **Strong Authentication**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.\n- **Vigilance**: Users should be cautious when approving access requests and report any unusual activity.\n\n#### 4. Technical Security Implementation Details\n- The system integrates with various data sources to gather contextual information, likely using APIs and a policy engine to evaluate access requests dynamically. While specific technologies aren't detailed, the approach suggests a scalable and adaptable architecture.\n\n#### 5. Data Protection Measures\n- While encryption and data loss prevention aren't explicitly mentioned, the enhanced access control implies a stronger defense against data breaches by mitigating unauthorized access risks.\n\n#### 6. Best Practices for End Users\n- **Stay Informed**: Keep software updated and educate yourself on security best practices.\n- **Use Secure Devices**: Ensure devices used for access are trusted and secure.\n- ** Monitor Activity**: Set up alerts for unusual access attempts to promptly address potential security issues.\n\n### Conclusion\nResilient Access 3.0's contextual access control offers a robust security enhancement by considering multiple factors, aligning with industry trends like zero trust architecture. While more details on compliance and technical specifics would be beneficial, the feature promises improved security outcomes for users.",
