Historically a closed loop system with fixed OS-level application only, we opened it up to mobile and other platforms. We started with making some small changes to allow the typical user to select the type of content they want to post, with the click of one button. We are also providing more options and features to the more advanced user by adding a new section not visible right away, but only accessible once a user gains a certain level of experience. After our developers were working on this, we concluded that there are some inadequacies with the current UI such as not being supported in some older browsers and not being reactive to mobile. Due to these problems we have decided to work on a complete UI rewrite of the application to bring a cleaner and more user-friendly interface to the user. Through this process we have actually acquired a new tool in our arsenal to assist in this called Balsamiq . This piece of software allows you to rapidly wireframe and design application very effectively. One of the greatest things about it is that it doesnt allow you to get too caught up on colors and images that you are going to be using but really focus on the user experience and layout of the application. We have also found that using completely custom CSSJS for the application was not the best option. Using a framework called Bootstrap, developed by Twitter, we can create an incredibly high responsive application across all platforms. For fellow developers, examine their grid system  you might be very interested. Over the next few weeks keep a look out for updates and new features being announced. We are working heavily on ARALOC and bringing a facelift to the valuable features it offers and expanding on the mobile-first footprint capability it has led with for years and years!

Here's a structured and organized approach to security guidance for end-users, incorporating the thought process and considerations:\n\n---\n\n### Security Guidance for End-Users\n\n#### 1. Security Best Practices\n- **Strong Passwords:** Use a password manager to create and store complex passwords. Treat them like a combination lock on a safe\u2014keep them private and change them periodically.\n- **Software Updates:** Regularly update software and apps from trusted sources to protect against vulnerabilities.\n\n#### 2. Data Protection Recommendations\n- **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data using tools like SSL for transmission and AES for storage. Consider using tools like BitLocker or VeraCrypt.\n- **Access Controls:** Limit data access to necessary personnel. Use role-based access control (RBAC) in systems where possible.\n- **Backups:** Schedule regular backups to secure locations, both physical and cloud-based, to ensure data recovery.\n\n#### 3. Safe Usage Guidelines\n- **Email and Links Caution:** Avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing sensitive info via email. Verify requests through a different channel.\n- **Secure Networks:** Prefer private Wi-Fi over public networks when using ARALOC. Consider a VPN for public Wi-Fi use.\n\n#### 4. Common Security Risks and Prevention\n- **Phishing:** Be vigilant with emails and messages. Use anti-phishing tools and educate yourself on spotting fake communications.\n- **Malware:** Avoid downloads from untrusted sites and use reputable antivirus software. Regularly scan your device.\n- **Session Management:** Log out of accounts, especially on shared devices, to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n#### 5. Privacy Protection Measures\n- **Data Encryption:** Use tools like HTTPS and TLS for data in transit and encrypted storage solutions.\n- **Privacy Tools:** Employ tools like VPNs and privacy browsers to control data sharing. Monitor app permissions.\n- **Data Minimization:** Collect only essential data and retain it only as long as necessary.\n\n#### 6. When to Seek Additional Security Support\n- **Suspicious Activity:** Contact support if you notice unusual account behavior.\n- **Sensitive Data Handling:** Seek advice if unsure about protecting sensitive data.\n- **Public Wi-Fi Use:** Consider IT support or VPN services for secure browsing on public networks.\n\n#### 7. ARALOC-Specific Tips\n- **browser and Device Support:** Use updated browsers and devices to avoid vulnerabilities.\n- **Content Sharing:** Be cautious with content sharing; use secure methods and verify recipient authenticity.\n\n---\n\nThis guidance is designed to be practical and accessible, helping end-users protect themselves and their data while using platforms like ARALOC.",
