Many are using email archiving solutions to meet these needs but outdated technology can introduce significant bottlenecks and prevent them from responding quickly and accurately. A government agency recently faced this challenge. With an outdated email archiving solution the agency was struggling to manage high volumes of FOIA and privacy requests. The legacy system was complex and required advanced IT skills causing delays and impacting the quality of responses. It was clear a more streamlined and user friendly solution was needed. A cloud based email archive is a modern alternative providing cost effectiveness, efficient management and security. Organizations are moving to cloud archives for better performance and easier data retrieval for audits so its the perfect solution for your organizations needs. What is Email Archiving? Email archiving is the process of storing email messages and attachments in a central location for long term retention and easy retrieval. Its a solution for organizations that need to store and manage large volumes of emails and meet regulatory and compliance requirements. Email archiving solutions provide a searchable repository for email messages so important data is preserved and easily retrievable. The Challenge Complex Legacy Systems and Archived Data As the organization faced mounting legal and privacy-related requests, their reliance on a legacy email archiving system proved to be a barrier to success. The system lacked the necessary tools to quickly search, discover, and export data, which led to delays in processing requests. Non-IT staff found it challenging to navigate, and critical information was often buried in a sea of emails, causing further complications. Additionally, using PST files for email archiving introduced challenges such as corruption and difficulties in accessing data for eDiscovery. This inefficiency not only delayed compliance with FOIA requests but also increased the risk of missing critical legal deadlines or failing to meet privacy requirements. The legacy systems inefficiencies also heightened the risk of non-compliance with email archiving compliance regulations. With the stakes high, it became imperative to find a solution that could simplify and accelerate the process while ensuring compliance and data security.
