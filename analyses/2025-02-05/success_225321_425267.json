As we approach the peak of the income tax season in the United States, we can expect cyber-criminals to increase their efforts to intercept tax refund payments and steal personally identifiable information like Social Security Numbers. Case in point, Cyren threat researchers detected two recent spikes in phishing URLs related to the IRS. In total, Cyren detected 13,295 active tax scam URLS in March. Many of these URLS were first spotted in January and February as cyber-criminals deployed their phishing kits and tested their email content in preparation. Figure 1. Number of IRS-related phishing threats per day To evade detection, criminals will shorten the URLs using well-known services like LinkedIn. Many of the URLs that Cyren detected were shortened in this way. For example, the shortened URL  might lead to any one of these fraudulent pages      The webgetpaymentirs.com domain was registered very recently. Newly created domains should be viewed with suspicion. At the time of writing this article, the web server was hosted in Microsofts cloud. This is another common evasion tactic. Most businesses and Internet Service Providers will not block traffic to clouds owned by Microsoft, Google, or Amazon. The good news is these cloud hosting providers have robust fraud prevention processes and work hard to quickly spot and remove phishing and malware sites. The URLs were delivered via phishing emails of varying sophistication. Based on the reference to IRS Form K-1 and the dollar amount, its clear the criminals behind this campaign were targeting businesses. The first sample email included the phishing URL in an encrypted attachment, making detection more difficult. Also, note that the email body was customized to target a specific company the second redacted string is the company name. Figure 2. Targeted phishing email The second sample did not come from a targeted campaign, combining tactics of spam and phishing. Its reminiscent of the Nigerian Prince and Iraqi Lottery scams of old. Figure 3. Phishing and spam combined Note that several phishing URLs were hosted by the same domain, webgetpaymentirs.com. Each URL was for a different web page or input form, following a similar structure to phishing kits weve analyzed before. In this case, the links led potential victims to various web forms designed to harvest Personally Identifiable Information and payment details, but only after acknowledging a rather ironic warning message Figure 4. Learn more about industry trends, and how phishing kits work. Watch the Webinar Figure 4. This fake IRS site is for authorized use only! Figure 5. Victims of this scam are at high risk of identity theft Figure 6. Credit card details are always a favorite target of criminals Major events like business and individual tax filing deadlines will always lead to an increase in targeted scams. Businesses need to put in place reasonably controls to prevent employees from exposing payment details or being duped into making payments to fraudsters. An easy win is to set an acceptable level of financial loss and require the 2-person rule for any transaction above that threshold. For example, if the threshold is 5,000 but your corporate card has a limit of 30,000 it should require a quorum of employees to approve entering the card details in a website. Of course, this kind of process is meant to complement sound automated security that spots and removes suspicious messages from users mailboxes before they fall victim to scams.

Below is a detailed analysis based on the specified criteria:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Key Security Features and Their Benefits to Users**\n   - **Cyren's Threat Detection and Monitoring**: The content emphasizes Cyren's ability to detect phishing URLs and monitor threats in real-time. This feature benefits users by providing early warnings and blocking malicious URLs before they can cause harm.\n     - *Example*: Cyren detected 13,295 active tax scam URLs in March, demonstrating the effectiveness of their threat intelligence and detection capabilities.\n   - **URL Shortening Detection**: The content highlights how criminals use shortened URLs to evade detection. Cyren's ability to identify and flag these URLs helps users avoid falling victim to phishing attacks.\n     - *Example*: Criminals used LinkedIn URL shortening services to disguise malicious links, but Cyren identified these as suspicious.\n   - **Cloud Hosting Monitoring**: The content notes that attackers often host phishing pages on cloud services like Microsoft, Google, or Amazon to avoid detection. Cyren's monitoring of these services ensures that users are protected even when attackers use legitimate platforms.\n     - *Example*: The phishing domain `webgetpaymentirs.com` was hosted on Microsoft's cloud, but Cyren detected and flagged it as malicious.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Compliance Certifications and Regulatory Adherence**\n   While the content does not explicitly mention compliance certifications, it implies adherence to industry standards and regulations by discussing measures businesses can take to comply with financial and data security requirements:\n   - Companies are encouraged to implement controls such as the \"two-person rule\" for financial transactions, which aligns with regulatory requirements for fraud prevention.\n   - businesses are advised to adopt automated security solutions to monitor and block suspicious emails, which supports compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **User-Focused Security Recommendations**\n   The content provides several actionable recommendations for users:\n   - **Educate Employees**: Awareness training can help employees recognize phishing attempts, especially those targeting businesses with references to IRS forms or financial transactions.\n     - *Example*: Criminals targeted businesses using emails referencing IRS Form K-1, which employees should recognize as suspicious.\n   - **Implement the Two-Person Rule**: Require multiple approvals for financial transactions above a certain threshold to prevent unauthorized payments.\n     - *Example*: If a transaction exceeds $5,000, ensure that at least two employees approve it before proceeding.\n   - **Use Automated Security Tools**: Employ solutions like Cyren's URL Category Checker to block malicious URLs and detect phishing attempts before they reach users.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Technical Security Implementation Details**\n   - **URL Shortening Detection**: Cyren's system identifies and flags shortened URLs, which are often used in phishing campaigns to disguise malicious links.\n   - **Domain Reputation Analysis**: Newly registered domains (e.g., `webgetpaymentirs.com`) are viewed with suspicion, as they are often used in phishing campaigns.\n   - **Cloud Hosting Monitoring**: Cyren monitors cloud-hosted domains to detect and block phishing pages, even when attackers use legitimate cloud services.\n   - **Email Filtering**: Advanced email filtering solutions can detect encrypted attachments with phishing URLs, as seen in the targeted phishing campaigns described in the content.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Data Protection Measures**\n   - **Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Protection**: Phishing campaigns often target PII like Social Security Numbers and credit card details. Users should ensure that such data is encrypted and securely stored.\n   - **Fraud Prevention**: Cloud providers like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have robust fraud detection mechanisms, but businesses should still monitor for suspicious activity.\n   - **Data Backup**: Regular backups can help businesses recover quickly in case of a data breach or ransomware attack.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Best Practices for End Users**\n   - **Verify Email Sources**: Be cautious of unsolicited emails, especially those claiming to be from the IRS or requiring urgent action. Verify the sender's identity before clicking on links or providing sensitive information.\n   - **Avoid Shortened URLs**: Users should be wary of shortened URLs and avoid clicking on them unless they can verify the destination.\n   - **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require MFA for access to sensitive systems and financial accounts to add an extra layer of security.\n   - **Monitor for Phishing Attempts**: Use tools like Cyren's URL Category Checker to scan URLs before visiting them.\n   - **Report Suspicious Activity**: Encourage employees to report suspicious emails or URLs to the security team for analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe content underscores the importance of proactive security measures, user education, and technical controls to combat IRS-related phishing scams. By leveraging tools like Cyren's threat detection solutions, implementing best practices, and adhering to regulatory standards, businesses can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to these threats.",
