The emails are disguised as voice message notifications sent by Peach Telecom, which suggests that the campaign is targeting users in the UK. HTA files are loaded by the system using the program MSHTA.exe, and are executed by instantiating the Internet Explorer rendering engine MSHTML along with the required script engines such as jscript.dll and vbscript.dll. Opening the HTA file in a text editor shows use of the JScript language, which is used in most of the Locky campaigns. Cyren detects this downloader script variant as JSLocky.AY. Deobfuscating part of the code shows a decryption code structure similar to what we saw in the previous Locky samples we have analyzed. Each sample has at least four URLs from which it tries to download, and as usual the downloader script decrypts before executing. Similar to the variant we reported last week , the decrypted ransomware component is a DLL file and is loaded using rundll32.exe. We also observed that it no longer uses a code parameter along with the called export function. CYREN detects the decrypted DLL as W32Locky.IA. And just like the previously reported variant, this ransomware component finds and encrypts files in the affected system, renaming the files and appending the string .zepto as the file extension. Listed below are the files which are searched for and encrypted by this variant. .n64 .ltx .gif .c .lay .xltx .pdf .m4a .litesql .raw .php .ms11 Security copy .xltm .XLS .m4u .litemod .cgm .ldf .ms11 .xlsx .PPT .m3u .lbf .jpeg .mdf .sldm .xlsm .stw .mid .iwi .jpg .ibd .sldx .xlsb .sxw .wma .forge .tif .MYI .ppsm .slk .ott .flv .das .tiff .MYD .ppsx .xlw .odt .3g2 .d3dbsp .NEF .frm .ppam .xlt .DOC .mkv .bsa .psd .odb .docb .xlm .pem .3gp .bik .cmd .dbf .mml .xlc .p12 .mp4 .asset .bat .db .sxm .dif .csr .mov .apk .sh .mdb .otg .stc .crt .avi .gpg .class .sql .odg .sxc .key .asf .aes .jar .SQLITEDB .uop .ots wallet.dat .mpeg .ARC .java .SQLITE3 .potx .ods .vob .PAQ .rb .011 .potm .hwp .mpg .tar.bz2 .asp .010 .pptx .602 .wmv .tbk .cs .009 .pptm .dotm .fla .bak .brd .008 .std .dotx .swf .tar .sch .007 .sxd .docm .wav .tgz .dch .006 .pot .docx .mp3 .gz .dip .005 .pps .DOT .qcow2 .7z .pl .004 .sti .3dm .vdi .rar .vbs .003 .sxi .max .vmdk .zip .vb .002 .otp .3ds .vmx .djv .js .001 .odp .xml .wallet .djvu .h .pst .wb2 .txt .upk .svg .asm .onetoc2 .123 .CSV .sav .bmp .pas .asc .wks .uot .re4 .png .cpp .lay6 .wk1 .RTF After encrypting the files, the desktop wallpaper is replaced with the ransom instructions and the ransom instructions page is loaded. Clicking on the tor links redirects the users to the Locky decryptor page.

    "content": "To protect yourself from Locky ransomware, follow these organized steps:\n\n1. **Email Caution**: Be wary of unexpected emails, especially those with spelling errors or from unknown senders. Avoid opening attachments or clicking links from unverified sources.\n\n2. **Disable HTA Execution**: Adjust browser settings to prompt before opening downloads, especially HTA files. Consider using security tools to block malicious file types.\n\n3. **Macro Settings**: Disable macros in Microsoft Office by default. Only enable them when necessary and from trusted sources.\n\n4. **Regular Backups**: Schedule weekly backups and store them offline or in a secure cloud service. This ensures data recovery even if files are encrypted.\n\n5. **Antivirus Software**: Ensure your antivirus is updated and consider enabling behavior monitoring to detect suspicious activities.\n\n6. **File Monitoring**: Watch for unusual file extensions like .zepto. Immediately disconnect from the internet and seek help if you notice such files.\n\n7. **URL Filtering**: Use a web filter or URL scanner to block malicious websites. Consider browser extensions that check website reputations.\n\n8. **System Updates**: Regularly update your operating system and software to patch vulnerabilities.\n\n9. **Network Caution**: Use a guest network or consider network segmentation to limit the spread of malware.\n\n10. **Monitor Activity**: Keep an eye out for unusual network behavior or file transfers and take prompt action if something seems amiss.\n\n11. **Security Awareness**: Stay informed about cyber threats through resources like SANS Security Awareness and PhishMe.\n\n12. **Strong Passwords**: Use a password manager to create and store unique, complex passwords for all accounts.\n\n13. **Seek Help**: If infected, contact a professional before paying a ransom to explore data recovery options.\n\nImplement these steps methodically, starting with the simplest changes, to enhance your security against Locky ransomware.",
