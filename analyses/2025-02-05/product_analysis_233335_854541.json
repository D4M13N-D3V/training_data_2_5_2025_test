The implications here are significant, given that many of todays security solutions rely on the ability to identify and halt malicious macros usually found in attached documents. Attachments Without Macros Initially discovered by researchers at SensePost , the Microsoft DDE vulnerability is already being used to deliver malware campaigns via attachments without using macros . Different malware campaigns using the DDE exploit in malicious email attachments which deploy remote access trojans, banking trojans, and ransomware payloads are being found on an almost daily basis. For email messages, the DDE exploit is triggered if you click on the reply button in some cases, and in others is triggered by simply opening the emails. Cyren detects the malicious Word documents exploiting the DDE features as XMLDDEDownldr.A!Camelot and XMLDDEDownldr.B!Camelot. And a New Infection Technique No Attachments Necessary In addition to this newly discovered DDE technique using Microsoft Word, there is an alternative infection technique discovered by researcher Kevin Beaumont that works in Outlook Email and Calendar invites, which further eliminates the need for maliciously crafted and attached documents. In these instances, the criminal need only embed the malware code in the body of the email or calendar invite. Once the email or invite is opened, the malware executes. We tried to replicate the newly found vector, which has not been found in the wild yet, and can confirm that it works. We describe the process below. For calendar invites, the DDE exploit is triggered every time the invitatation is opened, both when received and when opened as calendar notifications. Outlook messages and calendar invites are detected as RTFDDEDownldr.A!Camelot and RTFDDEExploit.gen!Camelot. Figure 1 DDE was successfully triggered by the crafted calendar invite How It Works To examine how an Outlook mail message stores the DDE links, we exported the DDE calendar invite POC to disk. Outlook saves email messages and calendar invites in the Microsoft MSG file format. Using a modified version of the olebrowse module from oletools , we can view the following MSG stream details both in the GUI and from the console output Stream path Stream size Stream property tag ID Stream property tag data type First 0x20 bytes of the stream console output only Figure 2 Modified olebrowse window output Figure 3 Modified olebrowse console output As highlighted in figure 3, we find a compressed RTF object after the PidTagBody value !Unexpected End of Formula from the olebrowse window. By selecting this stream, we can dump the following hex data Figure 4 PidTagRtfCompressed object hex dump The compressed RTF file format specification follows the structure below Offset Size Description Remarks 0x00 0x04 COMPSIZE 0x04 0x04 RAWSIZE 0x08 0x04 COMPTYPE COMPRESSED  0x75465a4c LZFu 0x0c 0x04 CRC Integrating the decompress function created by Dmitry Alimov in olebrowse save stream functionality, we were able to dump the decompressed format of the RTF containing the DDE link and see the following RTF entries Figure 5. Save decompressed stream to file Figure 6. Decompressed RTF format showing DDE field entry What To Do About It Although we have yet to see this Office feature exploited in the wild, there are several ways to mitigate or prevent infection. This particular attack still needs user intervention to be successful. One way to protect from attacks leveraging DDE is by disabling the Update Automatic Links at Open option in the Microsoft Office programs. Please note that we only tested it on Microsoft Word 2016. Figure 7 Option to disable Update Automatic links at open in Word 2016 File-Options-Advanced-General- Uncheck Update automatic links at open The attack can be also mitigated by modifying the registry as shared by wdormann . It will disable DDE to automatically execute the payload for Microsoft Outlook, Word, OneNote, and Excel versions 2010, 2013, 2016.

Of course, we highly advise users to always be vigilant and think first before clicking or opening email or meeting invites from unknown senders.

  "analysis": "### 1. Key Security Features and Capabilities\n\nThe analysis highlights several security features and capabilities designed to protect users from DDE-based attacks:\n\n- **Detection of Malicious Content**: The system can detect malicious Word documents and Outlook messages exploiting the DDE vulnerability. These are identified as `XMLDDEDownldr.A!Camelot`, `XMLDDEDownldr.B!Camelot`, `RTFDDEDownldr.A!Camelot`, and `RTFDDEExploit.gen!Camelot`.\n\n- **Exploit Mitigation**: Measures such as disabling the \"Update Automatic Links at Open\" option in Microsoft Office programs and modifying the registry to prevent DDE from automatically executing payloads are available. This mitigates the risk of infection through malicious emails or calendar invites.\n\n- **Decompression and Analysis Tools**: The use of tools like `olebrowse` and decompression functions allows for the detailed analysis of malicious RTF (Rich Text Format) files, helping to identify and understand the exploit mechanisms.\n\n- **User Intervention Requirement**: The exploit requires user interaction (e.g., opening an email, clicking on a link, or accepting a calendar invite) to execute, providing an additional layer of defense if users are cautious.\n\n- **Cross-Application Protection**: The mitigation measures apply to multiple Microsoft Office applications, including Word, Outlook, OneNote, and Excel, ensuring comprehensive protection across common attack vectors.\n\n### 2. User Benefits and Protection Measures\n\n- **Protection Against Macro-less Malware**: The system protects against malware that does not rely on malicious macros, which are traditionally a common vector for attacks.\n\n- **Defense-in-Depth**: By leveraging both Office settings and registry modifications, users benefit from multiple layers of defense against DDE-based attacks.\n\n- **Reduced Risk of Social Engineering**: Since the exploit often relies on user interaction, user education and awareness programs can significantly reduce the risk of infection.\n\n- **Comprehensive Malware Detection**: The detection of malicious content ensures that users are protected from various types of payloads, including remote access trojans, banking trojans, and ransomware.\n\n- **Minimal Disruption**: Mitigation measures such as disabling automatic link updates or modifying the registry do not significantly impact the usability of Office applications for most users.\n\n### 3. Integration with Existing Security Systems\n\n- **Compatibility with Microsoft Office**: The mitigation techniques are designed to work seamlessly with Microsoft Office 2010, 2013, and 2016, ensuring that users can continue using their familiar productivity tools without compromising security.\n\n- **Enhancement of Email Security**: By integrating with existing email security solutions, the system enhances the overall protection against phishing and malware attacks delivered via email.\n\n- **Support for Security Tools and Frameworks**: The use of tools like `oletools` and custom scripts for registry modification demonstrates the system's ability to integrate with broader security frameworks and tools.\n\n- **Scalability**: Organizations can easily implement these measures across their entire fleet of devices, ensuring consistent security policies and reducing the risk of DDE-based attacks.\n\n### 4. Compliance and Certification Details\n\n- **Regulatory Compliance**: Protecting against DDE-based attacks aligns with broader regulatory requirements for data protection, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and others, by ensuring that adequate measures are in place to prevent data breaches.\n\n- **Industry Standards**: The use of industry-standard tools and protocols for detecting and mitigating malware ensures compliance with best practices for cybersecurity.\n\n- **Documentation**: Organizations can leverage the detailed analysis and mitigation steps provided to demonstrate compliance with security standards during audits.\n\n### 5. Security Best Practices for Users\n\n- **User Education**: Train users to be cautious when opening emails, attachments, or calendar invites from unknown senders.
