This particular phishing scheme used COVID-19-related lures to defraud Microsoft 365 customers. Its one of many attacks weve seen. With tensions high and IT resources stretched to the limit, the pandemic is the perfect storm for cloud inbox security. Related Microsoft 365 Is Wildly Successful and Profoundly Vulnerable  Heres Why But this isnt a 2020 phenomenon The really sobering stat? Before Covid-19, 78 of Microsoft 365 administrators were already reporting security breaches, citing phishing as the leading cause. And according to the FBIs 2019 Internet Crime Report , those phishing attacks cost US businesses and local governments 1.7 billion last year. No matter the state of the pandemic, vaccinations, or a return to somewhat normal life, Microsoft will remain uniquely vulnerable to phishing Its native security has a 16 false negative rate for spam and phishing emails, according to Mimecast. If a scammer uses a spoofedlookalikesoundalike domain that doesnt exactly match your domain name, Microsoft 365 wont flag the activity. It also wont flag spoofed domains for your business partners or even well-known brands. Saleforce.com will still go through. Microsoft 365 uses static blacklists when scanning URLs for threats. Meanwhile phishing sites can have short life spans, even just a few hours. Analyzing each site in real time is a far stronger form of prevention. And Microsoft 365 has features such as Safe Attachments , which uses virtual sandboxing to scan attachments in an email. But sophisticated threats require deeper inspection of embedded documents and code. Inbox Detection and Response is our best defense Enterprises using cloud-hosted email urgently need an inner layer of email security called Inbox Detection and Response IDR. While the trusty Secure Email Gateway filters spam and known threats, it cant detect sophisticated or evasive attacks like spear phishing and cousin domain spoofing. IDR solutions instead hook into users inboxes, continuously scan all inbound and outbound emails in all folders, and automatically follow links. They check URLs for favicons, mismatched logos, legitimate site maps, domain owners, security certificates, even regionalized code  all indicators that help flag, Is this a valid email or is it phishing? Best of all, when threats are uncovered, IDR solutions can automatically delete every copy across every mailbox. This automatic remediation removes the burden on the email administrator or security analyst and massively reduces the feared window of vulnerability caused by malicious emails lingering for lengthy periods within the reach of users.
