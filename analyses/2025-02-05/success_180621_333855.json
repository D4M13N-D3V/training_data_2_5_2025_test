The Bank has made its relationship with Data443 a foundational component of its strategic plan to support its cloud first approach which rapidly migrate its data and user base to the cloud. This Agreement and its strategic relationship enable the Bank to easily subscribe to Data443 additional products on an ad-hoc basis. When the vetting process began in July 2019, competing vendors were required to execute a proof of concept and pilot program that satisfied a designed to break criteria, covering a wide swath of use cases, technologies and capabilities that the bank required immediately  and in the future.

From this process, we have increasingly adapted these lessons into adjustments to our product line, making ClassiDocs, Global Privacy Manager and the rest of our privacy and SaaS suites even better because of it, and continue to reap the rewards. Our results in 2020 demonstrated that success  even in an incredibly challenging year. 2021 continues to build on that foundation of success and strength.
