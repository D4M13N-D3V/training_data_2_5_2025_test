We have moved quickly to ramp our capabilities to meet the growing demand for enterprise protection of data across cloud, hybrid cloud, and on-premises. Historically, through the adoption of regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, we have always taken an approach of building out our capabilities to meet the evolving landscape of data privacy and security. Then last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a rule that would impose mandatory reporting for companies around data breaches and other significant cybersecurity incidents within four days. As a Company, we have always understood that data security and privacy legislation would continue driving significant investment by organizations to offset risks from data breaches and damaging information disclosures. In 2021, we continued to manage the business closely. We worked hard to reduce our loss on derivative liabilities by nearly 7 million, or 92 from a year ago, when we reduced our derivative liabilities by over 10 million. At the same time, we managed to close two additional and critically important acquisitions and expanded our marketing footprint to grow awareness of the Data443 product suite. To this day, we are capitalizing on the market opportunities that were experiencing, from the pursuit of new business opportunities to the steady flow of acquisition candidates that we evaluate on a regular basis. While I am encouraged by the strong demand across our business, we will continue to invest in sales and marketing campaigns, with specific product focus on innovation and internal talent development. We look forward to continued success in 2022 as we continue to focus on revenue growth, expanding customer success, technical innovation, and delivering shareholder value. I am optimistic about our future as we pursue our up-list to a national exchange, and we execute on our plans to deliver superior technology to our customers, concluded Mr. Remillard.

      "user_guidance": "### Practical Security Guidance for End Users\n\nAs a security advisor, my goal is to provide you with easy-to-follow recommendations to help you protect your data, maintain privacy, and stay safe online. Below are some best practices and guidelines to help you secure your personal and professional information:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**\n- **Why**: MFA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access.\n- **How**: Enable MFA whenever possible, especially for sensitive accounts like email, banking, and cloud storage. Use an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator) or a physical security key instead of SMS-based MFA, as SMS can be vulnerable to interception.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Use Strong, Unique Passwords**\n- **Why**: Weak or reused passwords are a leading cause of data breaches.\n- **How**:\n  - Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.\n  - Avoid using the same password across multiple accounts.\n  - Choose passwords that are at least 12 characters long and include a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Keep Software Updated**\n- **Why**: Updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit.\n- **How**:\n  - Enable automatic updates for your operating system, browser, and applications.\n  - Regularly check for updates on devices like smartphones, tablets, and smart home devices.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Back Up Your Data Regularly**\n- **Why**: Backups protect your data in case of a breach, ransomware attack, or accidental deletion.\n- **How**:\n  - Use the **3-2-1 backup rule**: 3 copies of your data, 2 different storage types (e.g., external drive and cloud), and 1 offsite copy.\n  - Schedule automatic backups to save time and ensure consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Protect Sensitive Data**\n- **Why**: Sensitive data, such as financial information or personal identifying information (PII), is a prime target for attackers.\n- **How**:\n  - Encrypt sensitive files before storing them in the cloud or on external devices.\n  - Use secure file-sharing methods, such as encrypted email or secure collaboration tools.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Monitor Your Data Activity**\n- **Why**: Detecting unusual activity early can prevent a small issue from becoming a major breach.\n- **How**:\n  - Review account login history and transaction records regularly.\n  - Set up alerts for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized login attempts or large transactions.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Use Public Wi-Fi Safely**\n- **Why**: Public Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured and can be used by hackers to intercept data.\n- **How**:\n  - Avoid accessing sensitive accounts (e.g., banking or shopping) on public Wi-Fi.\n  - Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your internet traffic when connecting to public networks.\n\n---\n\n### **8. Verify Downloads and Links**\n- **Why**: Malware and phishing attacks often disguise themselves as legitimate downloads or links.\n- **How**:\n  - Only download software or files from trusted sources.\n  - Hover over links in emails or messages to check their destination before clicking.\n  - Be cautious of unsolicited attachments or links, even from people you know.\n\n---\n\n### **9. Be Cautious with Emails and Messages**\n- **Why**: Phishing attacks are a common way for hackers to steal credentials or distribute malware.\n- **How**:\n  - Verify the sender\u2019s email address before responding or clicking on links.\n  - Look for spelling or grammatical errors in emails, as these are often signs of phishing.\n  - Never provide sensitive information in response to an unsolicited email or message.\n\n---\n\n### **10. Secure Your Devices**\n- **Why**: Unsecured devices can be an easy target for attackers.\n- **How**:\n  - Use a screen lock or biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint or face recognition) for all devices.\n  - Enable full-disk encryption on laptops and mobile devices.\n  - Keep Bluetooth and Wi-Fi turned off when not in use to reduce the risk of unauthorized connections.\n\n---\n\n### **11. Understand Common Security Risks**\n- **Why**: Knowing the risks helps you take steps to avoid them.\n- **Common Risks and Prevention**:\n  - **Ransomware**: Regular backups and avoiding suspicious downloads can help prevent ransomware attacks.\n  - **Insider Threats**: Limit access to sensitive data to only those who need it.\n  - **Phishing**: Educate yourself and others on how to spot phishing attempts.\n  - **Physical Breaches**: Keep devices and physical documents secure to prevent theft.\n\n---\n\n### **12. Protect Your Privacy**\n- **Why**: Protecting your privacy reduces the risk of identity theft and targeted attacks.\n- **How**:\n  - Use privacy settings on social media to limit who can see your personal information.\n  - Avoid oversharing sensitive details online.\n  - Use a privacy-focused web browser and search engine (e.g., DuckDuckGo).\n\n---\n\n### **13. Safely Dispose of Data**\n- **Why**: Improperly discarded data can be recovered and used maliciously.\n- **How**:\n  - Use secure deletion tools to erase data from devices before recycling or selling them.\n  - Shred physical documents containing sensitive information.\n\n---\n\n### **14. Stay Informed**\n- **Why**: Cybersecurity threats evolve constantly, so staying informed helps you stay protected.\n- **How**:\n  - Follow reputable sources (e.g., SANS Institute, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) for updates on the latest threats and security tips.\n  - Participate in cybersecurity training or workshops if available.\n\n---\n\n### **15. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- **Why**: Sometimes you need expert help to address complex security challenges.\n- **Scenarios**:\n  - After a security breach or suspected breach.\n  - When implementing new systems or technologies.\n  - For businesses: Conducting regular security audits or penetration testing.\n  - For individuals: Dealing with identity theft or ransomware attacks.\n\n---\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches, protect your privacy, and stay safe in an increasingly connected world. Remember, security is an ongoing process\u2014stay vigilant and adapt as threats evolve."
