The fraudulent email tries to trick the recipient into opening a PDF by suggesting that the victims tax refund information is now available for viewing. Once the email is opened, the victim is encouraged to click a link which redirects to a phishing site seeking the victims personal credentials. These phishing documents are detected and blocked by Cyren as PDFPhishing1.CYO. Figure 1 HMRC Refund Phishing E-mail Link Redirection Scheme to Fool Security Upon opening the attachment, victims find a document that uses a logo similar to the actual HMRC logo. To make the document appear more legitimate, the fraudsters include a dollar amount for the tax refund and then use scare tactics to encourage link clicks by telling recipients If you dont create a government gateway account, you will not receive your refund. Figure 2 HMRC Tax Refund Phishing Document In examining the phishing email and attachments, Cyren found a link redirection scheme involving legitimate sites, such as Google or Adclick, to make the request seem genuinea common technique often used to cloak malicious phishing URLs. Taking advantage of these redirection schemes may circumvent email and URL blocking due to the presence of legitimate domains, which are commonly whitelisted by most scanning services. Phishing URL Masquerades as Adclick URL As shown in the examples below, the actual phishing URL is passed as the ad url parameter Figure 3 Criminals attempt to obfuscate the phishing URL by passing it as an Adclick URL Cyren identified the following Adclick links redirecting to a phishing site hxxpocean-graphics.com.aumonday hxxprosemarosszeky.comsaturday hxxpmacchiagroup.com.auWednesday hxxpmarindasdancing.comWednesday hxxpwww.leesons.com.aualterome hxxpocean-graphics.com.aumonday hxxprosemarosszeky.comsaturday hxxpmacchiagroup.com.auWednesday hxxpmarindasdancing.comWednesday hxxpwww.leesons.com.aualterome hxxpwww.lmische.com.auscreen Cyren also identified the following websites as possibly hacked to host phishing sites related to this tax scam hxxpocean-graphics.com.aumonday hxxptherockinghorsestable.com.auSaturday hxxpaustudentvisa.com.auhome hxxpmangowoodfarmalpacas.com.auhome hxxpwww.lmische.com.auscreen Figure 4 Site has been flagged as possibly hacked Tax Season Means More Scams With tax season underway, email scams will certainly be increasing.
