There are still more questions than answers regarding this new ransomware campaign , but Cyren researchers have confirmed that the malware has married a derivation of last years Petya ransomware with the wormlike EternalBlue exploit, used by WannaCry only last month to spread from computer to computer via a vulnerability in a Microsoft file sharing protocol, details of which we discussed here . Email Inbox Identified, But Now Victims Cant Get their Decryption Keys This new Petya ransomware variant asks for the equivalent of 300 in Bitcoin to be transferred to the Bitcoin address 1Mz7153HmuxXTuR2R1t78mGsdzaAtNbBWX. You can see the account details and confer how many ransom payments have been at the Blockchain page here . After sending 300 worth of Bitcoin to the address, the victim is supposed to send his Bitcoin wallet ID and his personal installation key to the address  to receive the decryption key. It has now been confirmed that the e-mail provider Posteo has blocked this address, so even if you pay, you will not get the decryption key, since the attacker will not receive the victims e-mail. How It Works THe Petya variant uses the rundll32.exe process to run itself. Files are then encrypted by a file in the Windows folder called perfc.dat Sha-256 027cc450ef5f8c5f653329641ec1fed91f694e0d229928963b30f6b0d7d3a745. Petya schedules a task to reboot the victims computer within an hour. schtasks.exe  TR CWindowssystem32shutdown.exe r f The Master Boot Record MBR is modified in such a way that the encryption is carried out, and a custom bootloader is loaded that shows the ransom note and prevents the computer from booting into the Windows operating system. Here is the ransom note that is displayed after the computer has rebooted Doesnt Use a New Extension Petya encrypts files with the following file extensions, but does not add a new extension like most ransomware today 3ds .7z .accdb .ai .asp .aspx .avhd .back .bak .c .cfg .conf .cpp .cs .ctl .dbf .disk .djvu .doc .docx .dwg .eml .fdb .gz .h .hdd .kdbx .mail .mdb .msg .nrg .ora .ost .ova .ovf .pdf .php .pmf .ppt .pptx .pst .pvi .py .pyc .rar .rtf .sln .sql .tar .vbox .vbs .vcb .vdi .vfd .vmc .vmdk .vmsd .vmx .vsdx .vsv .work .xls .xlsx .xvd .zip Cyren detects the Petya ransomware attack as W32Ransom.Petya.J!Eldorado.

Cyren does not recommend paying the ransom fee and strongly encourages users to apply the MS17-010 security patch by running Windows Update. Its also good to block port 445.

  "analysis": "### Analysis of the 2017 Petya Ransomware Attack: Security Features and Capabilities\n\n#### 1. **Key Security Features and Capabilities**\n\nThe 2017 Petya ransomware attack highlighted several critical security features and capabilities that are essential for protecting against such threats:\n\n- **EternalBlue Exploit Mitigation**: The attack leveraged the EternalBlue exploit (MS17-010), which exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft's SMB protocol. Applying the MS17-010 patch is crucial to prevent the spread of this ransomware.\n\n- **Email-Based Ransom Payment Issues**: The ransomware directed victims to send payment to a Bitcoin address and then contact a specific email address for the decryption key. However, the email provider (Posteo) blocked the attacker's email address, rendering the ransom payment ineffective. This underscores the importance of having alternative communication channels and backups.\n\n- **File Encryption and MBR Modification**: Petya encrypts files and modifies the Master Boot Record (MBR), preventing the system from booting into the Windows operating system. This highlights the need for robust endpoint protection and regular system backups.\n\n- **Ransomware Detection**: Cyren detects the Petya ransomware as `W32Ransom.Petya.J!Eldorado`, demonstrating the importance of having advanced threat detection capabilities in place.\n\n#### 2. **User Benefits and Protection Measures**\n\n- **Prevention of Ransomware Spread**: Applying the MS17-010 patch and blocking port 445 can prevent the spread of Petya and similar ransomware that exploit SMB vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Early Detection and Alerts**: Advanced threat detection solutions like Cyren's can identify and alert on ransomware activity early, allowing for quicker response and mitigation.\n\n- **Protection of Critical Files**: Regular backups and the use of versioning systems can ensure that critical files are recoverable in the event of an attack.\n\n- **Communication Channel Disruption**: The blocking of the attacker's email address by Posteo prevented victims from sending their wallet IDs and installation keys, highlighting the importance of monitoring and blocking malicious communication channels.\n\n#### 3. **Integration with Existing Security Systems**\n\n- **Patch Management Integration**: Ensuring that systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches (e.g., MS17-010) is a critical component of endpoint protection and can be integrated into existing patch management processes.\n\n- **Network Segmentation**: Blocking port 445 can be implemented through network firewalls and can be integrated with existing network security policies to prevent the spread of ransomware.\n\n- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: Advanced threat detection solutions like Cyren's can be integrated with existing EDR systems to provide comprehensive protection against ransomware.\n\n- **Backup and Recovery Systems**: Regular backups and disaster recovery plans should be integrated into existing IT operations to ensure business continuity in the event of an attack.\n\n#### 4. **Compliance and Certification Details**\n\n- **Regulatory Compliance**: Implementing security patches and network segmentation measures aligns with regulatory requirements for data protection and privacy, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and NIST standards.\n\n- **Industry Best Practices**: Following best practices for ransomware prevention, such as regular backups, network segmentation, and endpoint protection, is essential for maintaining compliance with industry standards.\n\n#### 5. **Security Best Practices for Users**\n\n- **Apply Security Patches**: Regularly apply security patches, especially for known vulnerabilities like MS17-010, to prevent exploitation by ransomware.\n\n- **Block Vulnerable Ports**: Block port 445 to prevent the spread of ransomware that exploits SMB vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Backup Data**: Regularly backup critical data and ensure that backups are stored offline or in a secure, immutable storage solution.\n\n- **Avoid Paying Ransom**: Paying the ransom does not guarantee that you will receive the decryption key, as seen in the Petya attack where the attacker's email was blocked.\n\n- **Monitor for Threats**: Use advanced threat detection solutions to monitor for ransomware activity and respond quickly to incidents.\n\n- **Educate Users**: Educate users on the risks of ransomware and the importance of avoiding suspicious emails and attachments.\n\n#### 6. **Technical Specifications and Requirements**\n\n- **Operating System Requirements**: Ensure that all systems are running up-to-date versions of Windows with the latest security patches applied.\n\n- **Network Requirements**: Block port 445 at the network level to prevent the spread of ransomware that exploits SMB vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Backup Requirements**: Implement regular backups with versioning and ensure that backups are stored securely, both online and offline.\n\n- **Endpoint Protection**: Use advanced endpoint protection solutions that include threat detection, behavioral analysis, and response capabilities.\n\n- **Email Security**: Implement email security measures to block malicious emails and attachments that may contain ransomware.\n\n- **Incident Response Plan**: Have an incident response plan in place that includes procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from ransomware attacks.\n\nBy implementing these security features, capabilities, and best practices, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to ransomware attacks like Petya and ensure business continuity in the event of an attack."
