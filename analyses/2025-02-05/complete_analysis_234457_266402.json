Both big and small organizations are targets, with CEOs falling victim to whaling phishing targeted at executive staff as often as regular employees. A recent Osterman Research survey conducted on behalf of Cyren found phishing to be the top threat category for small- to medium-sized businesses up to 3,000 employees, with 43 suffering a phishing breach in the last 12 months. The reasons for the dramatic rise in phishing are fairly obvious. Driven by a constant desire to maximize revenue, cybercriminals realize that phishing is a relatively inexpensive way to obtain sensitive personal and financial information that can then be resold on the black market or used directly for monetary gain. The prominent use of PayPal in business transactions, as well as the increase in cloud-based business and productivity tools, such as Google Apps or Microsofts Office 365, provide a simple and effective hook for criminals to use in their attempts to lure victims into clicking fake links. Combined with an overall lack of password management at many companies, the likelihood that organizations will be targeted with phishing and ultimately be hacked is increasing dramatically. Because Cyren is uniquely positioned to observe, analyze, and halt phishing attacks as they happen, weve decided to focus our new quarterly trend report on the topic of phishing. We discuss how phishing happens and why, review the anatomy of a phishing attack see infographic , provide insight into the mind of a phisher, analyze the level of phishing protection you receive from various browsers, and examine the life cycle of a phishing site. Effective protection against phishing certainly begins with employee education, but the continuing shift to cloud-based services and mobility, and the increasingly sophisticated nature of these phishing attacks, requires innovation in security with the kind of real-time detection and blocking of suspected zero-hour phishing sites Cyrens security cloud provides.

      "user_guidance": "### Practical Security Guidance for Data Protection\n\n#### 1. **Easy-to-Follow Security Best Practices**\n   - **Use Strong Passwords**: Create unique, complex passwords for all accounts. Avoid using the same password across multiple platforms.\n   - **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to your phone) in addition to your password.\n   - **Keep Software Updated**: Regularly update your operating system, browser, and other software to protect against known vulnerabilities.\n   - **Be Cautious with Email**: Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unfamiliar or suspicious emails. Use email filtering tools to help identify phishing attempts.\n   - **Use a Reputable Antivirus Program**: Install and regularly update antivirus software to detect and block malicious activities.\n\n#### 2. **Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use encryption for sensitive data, both at rest and in transit. Tools like VPNs can help secure data when using public Wi-Fi.\n   - **Back Up Data Regularly**: Implement a regular backup schedule for important data. Store backups securely, both on-site and off-site.\n   - **Limit Access to Data**: Restrict access to sensitive data to only those who need it. Use role-based access controls to minimize exposure.\n\n#### 3. **Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Avoid Using Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Transactions**: Public Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured, making it easier for attackers to intercept your data. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a VPN.\n   - **Verify Requests**: Before responding to requests for personal or financial information, verify the legitimacy of the request directly with the sender using a known contact method.\n   - **Use Secure Communication Channels**: For sensitive communications, use encrypted messaging apps or email services.\n\n#### 4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Phishing Attacks**: Be aware of fake emails, websites, or messages that attempt to steal your personal information. Use anti-phishing tools and educate employees on spotting fake communications.\n   - **Malware and Ransomware**: Prevent infections by avoiding suspicious downloads and using antivirus software. Regularly back up data to recover in case of an attack.\n   - **Weak Passwords**: Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for all accounts.\n   - **Unsecured Wi-Fi**: Avoid accessing sensitive accounts or sharing personal information over unsecured public networks.\n\n#### 5. **Privacy Protection Measures**\n   - **Control Data Sharing**: Be mindful of the personal information you share online. Only provide necessary information when required.\n   - **Use Privacy Settings**: Adjust privacy settings on social media and other online platforms to limit who can see your personal information.\n   - **Dispose of Data Safely**: When disposing of devices or documents, ensure all sensitive data is properly erased or shredded.\n\n#### 6. **When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n   - **After a Security Incident**: If you suspect or confirm a breach, contact your IT or security team immediately. Consider engaging a cybersecurity professional to assess and mitigate the damage.\n   - **For Complex Threats**: If your organization faces advanced persistent threats or sophisticated attacks, seek expertise from cybersecurity firms or consultants.\n   - **During Migrations or Major IT Changes**: When migrating to cloud services or implementing new technologies, consult with security experts to ensure data is protected during the transition.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of cyber threats and protect your data effectively."
