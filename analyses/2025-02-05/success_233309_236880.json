About 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is created every day. Yet a recent Global Databerg Report suggested that 52 percent of all data stored by organisations globally is dark data, meaning its content and value is unknown. Additionally, 33 percent of data is considered redundant, which poses a serious threat given the EUs new laws regarding GDPR . When the laws come into place in May 2018, companies that neglect their data will be fined 4 per cent of the previous years annual global turnover or 20m, whichever is the higher . FileFacets easy-to-deploy, hybrid-cloud solution identifies sensitive and personal information, removes redundant data and facilitates the secure transfer between data repositories.
