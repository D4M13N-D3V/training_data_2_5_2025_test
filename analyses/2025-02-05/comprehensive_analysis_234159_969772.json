We previously reported our detection of key changes in Lockys methods on June 27  new sandbox evasion techniques , July 4  new downloading technique , July 14  attachment format change , and most recently July 21  embedded in JavaScript   the criminal syndicate behind Locky is evidently quite busy, and quite resourceful. The email being sent in this latest wave, as often before, uses business finance-related topics to lure users into opening its attachment, which is ZIP-archived JavaScript. Comparing this variant to the earlier variants, it has added another layer of obfuscation which decrypts and executes the real Locky downloader script. A quick de-obfuscation shows a similar structure to the previous Locky downloader scripts. The download behavior is similar to that seen before, as the files downloaded from the URLs inserted in the script are decrypted and dropped in the Windows Temp directory. What we find most interesting in this latest Locky wave is that instead of downloading an EXE binary, this ransomware component now comes as a DLL binary. Cyren detects this variant as W32Locky.AT_1.gen!Eldorado. The DLL is loaded using rundll32.exe with the following command line syntax Upon closer inspection, the DLL is using a custom packer to prevent anti-malware scanners from easily detecting it. Upon successful execution, the loaded DLL does its usual ransomware routine to find and encrypt files in the affected system, before dropping and displaying the ransom payment instruction pages. Files encrypted by this variant are appended with .zepto as their file extension. Clicking on the onion link directs the user to the same Locky Decryptor page we have seen in previous Locky waves.

  "analysis": "### Comprehensive Analysis of the Security-Related Content\n\nThe provided content discusses the evolution of the Locky ransomware, its delivery mechanisms, and the measures taken by Cyren to detect and mitigate this threat. Below is a detailed analysis based on the requested categories:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Key Security Features and Their Benefits to Users**\n- **Advanced Threat Detection**: Cyren's detection mechanisms, such as identifying JSLocky.AT!Eldorado and W32.Locky.AT_1.gen!Eldorado, demonstrate robust monitoring and detection capabilities. This ensures early identification of ransomware variants, reducing the risk of infection.\n- **Behavioral Analysis**: The article highlights how Locky's delivery mechanism has evolved, including the use of obfuscation and custom packers. This underscores the importance of solutions that employ behavioral analysis to detect malicious activity, rather than relying solely on signature-based detection.\n- **Educational Resources**: Cyren provides resources like the \"Ransomware Dominates: An In-Depth Look at Locky Ransomware\" report and URL Category Checker. These tools empower users with knowledge and practical insights to combat ransomware threats.\n\n**Benefits**: These features help users stay informed, detect advanced threats, and respond effectively to ransomware attacks.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Compliance Certifications and Regulatory Adherence**\nThe content does not explicitly mention compliance certifications or regulatory adherence. However, companies dealing with ransomware and cybersecurity solutions often adhere to standards like:\n- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: Ensures data protection and privacy for individuals.\n- **ISO 27001**: Demonstrates adherence to best practices for information security management.\n- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: Protects consumer data privacy.\n\nWhile not explicitly stated, organizations offering solutions like Cyren's are likely compliant with these standards, as they emphasize data security and user protection.\n\n---\n\n### **3. User-Focused Security Recommendations**\nThe content indirectly provides the following user-focused recommendations:\n- **Avoid Suspicious Emails**: Warns about business/finance-themed phishing emails used to deliver Locky. Users should be cautious when opening attachments or clicking links from unsolicited emails.\n- **Leverage Advanced Threat Detection**: Emphasizes the importance of using solutions like Cyren's to detect obfuscated scripts and malicious binaries.\n- **Backup Data Regularly**: Since Locky encrypts files with extensions like .zepto, regular backups are critical to recover data without paying ransoms.\n\n**Practical Guidance**:\n- Train users to recognize phishing attempts.\n- Use endpoint protection solutions with behavioral analysis.\n- Implement email filtering to block malicious attachments.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Technical Security Implementation Details**\nThe content highlights the following technical details about Locky's latest variant:\n- **Delivery Mechanism**: The ransomware is delivered via ZIP-archived JavaScript files, which are decrypted and executed to download the DLL binary.\n- **Obfuscation Techniques**: The JavaScript downloader script uses additional layers of obfuscation, making it harder for traditional antivirus solutions to detect.\n- **Execution Method**: The DLL is loaded using `rundll32.exe` with specific command-line arguments, indicating a sophisticated evasion technique.\n- **File Encryption**: Encrypted files are appended with the .zepto extension, and victims are directed to a Tor-based payment page.\n\n**Technical Mitigation**:\n- Monitor for unusual execution of `rundll32.exe`.\n- Block malicious URLs and zip archives at the email gateway.\n- Implement sandboxing solutions to analyze suspicious files before execution.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Data Protection Measures**\n- **Encryption**: Locky uses encryption to render files inaccessible, highlighting the need for strong encryption practices on the user's side.\n- **Backup Solutions**: Regular, secure backups ensure data recovery in case of ransomware attacks.\n- **Data Classification**: Tools like Cyren's \"Instant Data Classification\" can help organizations categorize and protect sensitive data.\n\n**Best Practices**:\n- Use end-to-end encryption for sensitive data.\n- Store backups offline or in secure cloud storage.\n- Regularly test backup restoration processes.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Best Practices for End Users**\n- **Stay Informed**: Keep up to date with the latest ransomware trends and delivery mechanisms.\n- **Use Strong Antivirus Solutions**: Employ solutions with advanced detection and behavioral analysis.\n- **Avoid Unsafe Downloads**: Refrain from opening attachments or clicking links from untrusted sources.\n- **Implement Security Updates**: Ensure all software is patched to protect against vulnerabilities.\n- **Monitor System Activity**: Look for suspicious processes, such as unexpected use of `rundll32.exe`.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe content provides a detailed analysis of Locky's evolution and highlights the importance of advanced detection mechanisms, user education, and robust data protection measures. By adhering to best practices, leveraging cutting-edge security tools, and staying informed, users and organizations can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to ransomware attacks like Locky."
