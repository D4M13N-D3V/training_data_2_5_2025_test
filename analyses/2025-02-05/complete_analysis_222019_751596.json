The Problem Overcoming Legacy and Cyber Threats For over a year the MSP was experiencing a huge amount of spam and phishing. Their previous providers solution was good enough in the past but was struggling to keep up with the new and more advanced threats like phishing and business email compromise. This was causing dissatisfaction among the MSPs clients and putting their reputation as a trusted service provider at risk. A solution was needed and Data443 filled that gap. Proof of Concept A Show of Hands Data443 ran a Proof of Concept  POC to demonstrate its advanced threat protection and email security solutions. The results were amazing.
