Since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the international community has been helping the victims by donating to various charities and providing direct assistance to those in need. Along with that, however, there are a lot of criminals ready to take advantage of the global tragedy and use this crisis as the platform for their crimes. For the last few months, Cyren Inbox Security has seen a rise in scams related to charity and donations. Cyren security experts explain that this type of fraud is very dangerous because its nature and content appeal to emotions. When so many people are in need for assistance and the entire world is willing to give a hand, it is truly challenging to distinguish between an actual request for help and a convincing scam. The perfect formula easy to implement, hard to detect A scam is a type of attack that is easy to implement as it doesnt require any special programming or engineering skills. To pull out this type of fraud, the scammer only needs to be persuasive and have good writing skills. Since requests for assistance and donations come from so many often unknown people and because the pattern of requests is random, the scammers can effortlessly avoid detection while security experts have the difficult job of preventing potential victims from being tricked.
