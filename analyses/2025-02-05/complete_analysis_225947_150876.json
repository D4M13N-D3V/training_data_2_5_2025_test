What is ransomware? Ransomware is a cyber attack that encrypts your files until you pay. This type of attack is malware that employs encryption  holding a victims information at ransom. A user or organizations data is first encrypted. This way, they cannot access their confidential files, databases, or applications. After this, a ransom is demanded so that the cybercriminal will provide access. Ransomware is typically designed to spread across networks  targeting database and file servers. It can thus quickly paralyze entire organizations. Ransomware is a growing threat, but it still generates billions of dollars in payments to cybercriminals each year  inflicting significant damage to businesses and government organizations . What are the stages of a ransomware attack? CYBER ATTACK Ransomware such as CryptoLocker, CryptoWall, and Locky targets your business with cyber attacks that leverage both email and the web to fool your employees and penetrate your defenses. ENCRYPTION These attacks encrypt all the files on a victims computer and connected network drives. RANSOM Once infected, you can either pay the ransom to regain access to your files, or give up all your precious data How does ransomware work? MALWARE DELIVERY You download malware from a spam email or a malicious URL. RANSOMWARE DOWNLOAD The malware downloads a ransomware executable to your computer. ENCRYPTION The ransomware encrypts your files. RANSOM NOTICE You are given a ransomware notice with a deadline. PAYMENT You are required to pay with Bitcoin. DECRYPTION The attacker provides a decryption key. Ransomware can encrypt your files in less than 60 seconds. Decrypting the files without the key is virtually impossible. The evolving ransomware threat and how to protect yourself New families and variants of ransomware are emerging all the time. Here are some ways you can protect yourself from these kinds of phishing attacks Backup all of your data Secure any of your backups Use security software and keep systems up to date Practice safe internet surfing Only utilize secure networks Stay informed on current ransomware threats Implement security awareness programs Deploy a post-delivery email detection and remediation solution Ransomware By the Billions Ransomware increased by an estimated 2300 in 2016 and by an additional 250 in 2017. During the initial Locky outbreak, Cyren observed up to 37 BILLION ransomware-infected emails being distributed in one day. Ransomware made easy Roll your own in minutes Found on the dark webs TOR network, Satan is a ransomware creation service that provides a complete, one-stop ransomware package for any would-be criminal. Ransomware-as-a-service packages significantly lower the barrier for entering the ransomware business, allowing even the not-so-technically-inclined to configure their own ransomware payload. For a small fee, the aspiring criminal only needs to register, log in, and follow simple configuration options like How many days until the payment period expires? to create a new variant of the Satan virus. Once the virus is created, the criminal downloads it and begins distribution.
