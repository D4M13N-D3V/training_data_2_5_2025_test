While in past lives I have done much in the WordPress plugin arena  for Data443 this is a run of many firsts.. Setting up the infrastructure, clearing out a backlog of bugs and enhancements, staging our next few sprints for the dev plan and working out the product plan of record. Additionally, much work is done behind the scenes  from a simple thing like updating the headline graphic to being able to push updates via SVN. Outside of the geek speak  why did we do this, and what is the plan? As we know  WordPress is a significant content platform management platform. Fully 100 of our new prospects and customers I have spoken to since we announced have WordPress  as I expected. Now, of course the public marketing site is usually run by a different group, etc. But as I was indicating to a customer prospect earlier today  I sort of have a soft spot in my heart for SMB organizations. Usually they are overwhelmed, underfunded and could use some help.. GDPR, FOI or other deep capability requirements are very difficult to fulfil and manage. So, WordPress is a great way to very quickly organize some capabilities for these organizations  and like I said, very close to 100 reach! So, in this case, what does it do? The WP GDPR Framework is a simple to deploy WordPress standards-based plugin that enables an administrator or site owner  within a few clicks  enable a cookie and privacy policy that is tailored to their needs. More than just a click here for this capability  the plugin enables something very special  the iceberg request  a Data Subject Access Request DSAR. The DSAR is a mandated capability that organizations much offer to any person with potential Privacy Information requests the ability to request for free in most cases where and for what purposes is their personal information being used within that company. In the simplest example  if you were an ecommerce company selling widgets online  a person must be able to request directly from you, and within 30 days get a response about how you are using their information. In this example, the response may contain the following details Dear SirMadam We have reviewed our data storage and have identified 3 locations where your information is resident. Previous Orders May 4, 2018  your address and contact information New Product Mailing List  your email address and how many times you viewed our notices. You have the option to remove or update any of this information indicated above. In this simpler example, our plugin will automate this process from receiving the request to consolidating the search results and then delivering them to the requestor. Depending on the action, our plugin will updateremediate based on the request response. Its a simple functionality, but desparately needed and removesmitigates significant work efforts if an organization has potentially 1000s of requests andor much data to manage. Quickly this becomes overwhelming, costly to manage  and then potentially material when considering fines and reputation damage. So, today we have capability for the majority of WordPress requirements on the public facing side. Going forward we expect to extend this into the ClassiDocs land  allowing the administrator to hook into their on premise and cloud repositories to facilitate DSARs.. While it would be unreasonable to expect every single WordPress installation to utilize ClassiDocs to extend to the enterprise  today we are the only ones to provide this capability Try it for Free Instant Data Classification Cyren URL Category Chacker Prev Jason Skinner, an expert on cloud, collaboration and digital transformation, joins Resilient as an Advisor Release 1.0.14 is now available of The WordPress GDPR Framework Next Company Partners Resources Investor Relations Products Freeware Demo Solutions Contact Us Privacy Management Service by Data443\n            \n            Your analysis should cover:\n            1.
