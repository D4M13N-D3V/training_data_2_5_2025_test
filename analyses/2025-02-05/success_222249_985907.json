The session opened with a somber question what keeps you up at night? The overwhelming majority of CISOs said theyre afraid users will click on something they shouldnt. And rightfully so  according to the 2019 Global Data Exposure Report , 78 of CSOs and 65 of CEOs admit to clicking on a link they should not have, showing that no level of employee is immune to lapses in judgment. Related How Machine Learning Is Building a Better Spam Trap Also universal? The reliance on security awareness training SAT as the solution. Each CISO at the roundtable already had a SAT program in place, some even have HR enforce testing similar to harassment training. And yet theyre still up at night worrying, probably because were asking our employees to match a  leap in attack sophistication  reported by Microsoft and the FBI. We know the responsibility were placing on employees is unreasonable. Meanwhile, ominous training and draconian enforcement leaves employees anxious, not empowered. Employees report more suspicious email following training, but the vast majority of those reports are false positives. And there is a cost to this. SOC teams are chronically understaffed, and investigating false positives sabotages strategic objectives. It feels obvious training is time consuming, and the false positives it breeds are even more distracting for the security team. In the wise words of a roundtable attendee employeetraining is necessary but not sufficient. Were using SAT as a crutch, and blaming user error for our failures to protect employees in the first place. After a pause, the same attendee said, truth hurts. Machines to the rescue The reality is users will always have a role to play identifying phishing attacks that are heavy on social engineering . But now machine learning can automatically detect and remediate 80-90 of evasive phishing threats Sender Behavior Analysis detects imposter or spoofed emails, using header analysis, cousin or look-alike domain detection, as well as natural language processing to determine whether the language in the body of an email might be indicative of social engineering. URL Behavior Analysis protects users from credential theft by extracting URLs from emails and examining the destination web page for evidence that it might be a phishing site. Mailbox Behavior Analysis profiles mailbox activity to create a baseline of trusted behaviors and relationships. Who sends emails to whom and at what time of day? What volumes? What do the contents look like? Mailboxes are then continuously monitored for anomalous behaviors and predictive analytics are used to detect threats. Incident Analysis Enables rapid investigation, containment, response and remediation of threats. Incidents are created whenever an email contravenes a security policy or is reported by the user.

    "content": "### End-User Guidance on Data Security and Protection\n\nHere are practical, easy-to-follow recommendations to help you protect yourself and your organization from cyber threats:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Security Awareness Best Practices**\n- **Stay Informed:** Keep up with common phishing and social engineering tactics. Be cautious of unsolicited emails, calls, or messages.\n- **Trust Your Instincts:** If an email or message seems unusual, urgent, or too good (or bad) to be true, it likely isn\u2019t legitimate.\n- **Verify Before Acting:** Pause before clicking on links, opening attachments, or providing sensitive information. Contact the sender directly to confirm the request.\n- **Report Suspicious Activity:** If you suspect a phishing attempt, report it to your IT or security team immediately.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Use Strong Passwords:** Create unique, complex passwords for all accounts. Use a password manager to securely store them.\n- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Whenever possible, add an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to your phone).\n- **Back Up Data Regularly:**Protect your important files by backing them up to an encrypted, secure location (e.g., an external drive or cloud storage).\n- **Encrypt Sensitive Information:**Use encryption for sensitive data, especially when sharing it via email or other communication channels.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Tasks:** Public Wi-Fi is often unsecured. Avoid accessing sensitive accounts or sharing personal information when using public networks.\n- **Keep Devices Updated:** Regularly update your operating system, browser, and software to protect against vulnerabilities.\n- **Be Mindful of Links and Attachments:** Never click on links or open attachments from unknown or suspicious sources.\n- **Use Secure Communication Tools:**For sensitive conversations, use encrypted messaging apps (e.g., Signal or WhatsApp).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Phishing Attacks:** Scammers may impersonate trusted individuals or companies to steal credentials or sensitive information. Prevent this by verifying the sender\u2019s identity and avoiding suspicious links.\n- **Malware and Ransomware:**Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and ensure your antivirus software is up to date.\n- **Social Engineering:**Scammers may manipulate you into sharing information. Always verify requests for sensitive data before complying.\n- **Device Loss or Theft:**Use a screen lock, GPS tracking, and remote wipedevice features to protect your data if your device is lost or stolen.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Adjust Privacy Settings:** Regularly review and update the privacy settings on your social media accounts, apps, and devices.\n- **Limit Personal Information Sharing:** Avoid oversharing personal details online, especially in public forums or with strangers.\n- **Monitor Accounts for Unauthorized Activity:** Check your bank statements, credit reports, and account activity regularly for signs of fraud.\n- **Use Privacy Tools:**Consider using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to protect your online activity and a privacy-focused browser for sensitive browsing.\n\n---\n\n### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- **If You\u2019ve Been Compromised:** If you suspect your account or device has been hacked, change your passwords immediately and contact your IT or security team.\n- **For Advanced Threats:** If you receive a highly sophisticated phishing attempt or suspect malware, don\u2019t hesitate to seek help from your organization\u2019s security team.\n- **For Lost or Stolen Devices:** Report lost or stolen devices to your organization\u2019s IT department and change any shared passwords.\n- **For Uncertainty:** If you\u2019re unsure about the safety of an email, link, or attachment, always err on the side of caution and seek advice from a trusted source.\n\n---\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to cyber threats and play a critical role in protecting yourself and your organization. Remember, security is everyone\u2019s responsibility!",
