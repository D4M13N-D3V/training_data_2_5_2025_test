In 2017, we discovered an email threat that was carrying not one, but two different malicious attachments as bait a PDF file and a Microsoft Template file OpenXMLDOTX. These were meant to target a previously reported Microsoft Office vulnerability in order to deliver the remote access trojan RAT known as NetWiredRC. What was NetWiredRC? According to MalwareBytes , Backdoor.NetWiredRC was the detection name for a large group of trojans , which were all targeting Windows systems. Backdoor.NetWiredRC is a flexible, versatile and dangerous threat which has also been utilized by state-sponsored groups such as APT33. It is known for stealing information, providing remote access, and even downloading additional malware. How did NetWiredRC Impact Users? Since Backdoor.NetWiredRC spreads primarily through malicious phishing campaigns, we believe the use of two attachments was intended to make the email seem more legitimate to recipients. Typically, hackers only send one malicious attachmentby sending two, the hackers increase the chances that the target will open at least one of them. In addition, the techniques applied within the attachments add a few layers of complexity in both the delivery of the exploit and the final payload, and are intended to help evade detection. How NetWiredRC Utilized the Fake Business Email The email being sent is in the guise of a business transaction purporting to be a request for quote RFQ, a sample of which is shown below. From a technical perspective, our analysis shows that neither attachment contains the actual exploit. Instead, the threat abuses feature in both the attached PDF and OpenXML documents to cause the automatic download and launch of the CVE-2017-11882 exploit, known as the Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability, for which Microsoft issued a patch in November 2017. This was one of the most well-known Microsoft Office virusesvulnerabilities of the year 2017, and caused a significant amount of damage to users. Cyren blocks this threat in its various elements as DOCXCVE-2017-11882.D.gen!Camelot, DOCXCVE-2017-11882.F.gen!Camelot, and W32NetWiredRC.CW. Figure 1. Email Sample containing two 2 bait attachments How the Malware PDF Works In examining the PDFs file structure , we find an embedded file named jon001.dotx, which appears to be a ZIP archive, but is actually a Word document using the Microsoft OpenXML format detected by Cyren as DOCXCVE-2017-11882.F.gen!Camelot. The embedded DOTX file jon001.dotx is the same as the attached DOTX specification.dotx, as shown below in the hash comparison between the two files. Figure 2.0. Shows the embedded and attached file hashes Figure 2.1. The PDF contains an embedded file called jon001.dotx which downloads and launches the DOCXCVE-2017-11882 exploit. The embedded document is set as an open action object, so it will also be loaded once the PDF is opened. Figure 2.2. PDF Stream showing the OpenAction object Avoiding Auto-Loading on Embedded Files When the intended victim tries to open the PDF file, he is also prompted to open the embedded file. It is important to note, however, that if the user has configured Adobe Reader to Always Allow the opening of similar file types, then this particular embedded object will automatically be loaded without prompting the user. Cyren recommends that to prevent the automatic loading of embedded files that may contain harmful content, computer users never set Adobe Reader to a default setting of Always Allow. Figure 3.0. Adobe Reader prompts users about opening the embedded document. Initially, the embedded document jon001.dotx does not appear to contain any exploits, but upon closer inspection into the document element worddocument.xml, we find the automatic loading of remote data via the linked OLEObject element. Figure 4.0. Linked OLEObject Following the reference ID _id_1437 for this OLEObject in relsdocument.xml.rels, reveals the URL from which the remote data will be downloaded. Figure 4.1. Remote data URL Understanding the Exploit Document The remote data is found in an RTF document called jon001.doc detected by Cyren as CVE-2017-11882.D.gen!Camelot. Similar to CVE-2017-0199, the CVE-2017-11882 RTF exploit takes advantage of the objupdate keyword to be able to trigger the malicious payload without user interaction. Figure 5.0. Preview of the RTF structure Unlike previous variants of malicious documents exploiting CVE-2017-11882 which usually trigger the exploit thru a URL moniker in a Microsoft Equation stream in the OLE object, this variant triggers the exploit using a shellcode found in an Ole10Native stream in the OLE object from the RTF document. Viewing the document in Microsoft Word would show the OleObject as an embedded Equation Object. Figure 6.0. Embedded Equation Object Figure 7.0. Shellcode found in the Ole10Native Stream. We first confirmed that the exploit was still taking advantage of the flaw in Equation Editor, and then used the Microsoft Global Flags Editor Gflags debugger utility to break on EQNEDT32.exe once the exploit is triggered. Figure 8.0. Global Flags Image File Debugger Configuration Based on an address range and data contained in a Palo Altos report on the CVE-2017-11882 exploit, we used the same information to debug the shellcode to confirm that the exploit attempts to download and execute a file from hxxpasurahomepg.rutwojon001.exe which is saved to disk using the filepath, APPDATAwindows.exe. Figure 9.0. CVE-2017-11882 Shellcode Debugging Backdoor Payload Unfortunately, the download URL was inaccessible at the time of our analysis, so we were not able to obtain the intended executable payload. However, we were able to download another payload using the same filename jon001.exe from a different directory at the same site hxxpasurahomepg.ruonejon001.exe. Cyren detects the jon001.exe file as a backdoor trojan named W32NetWiredRC.CW. A quick analysis of the jon001.exe downloaded executable shows that it is compiled in Visual Basic and is decompressed at runtime and injected into a suspended process of itself. By dumping the decompressed format of the payload into a file, we were able to identify it as a variant of a RAT known as NetWiredRC. The strings used in this backdoor are encrypted with two different encryption algorithms. Decryption 1 The first set of encrypted strings are encrypted with a custom Caesar Cipher using the following key _BqwHaF8TkKDMfOzQASx4VuXdZibUIeylJWhj0m5o2ErLt6vGRN9sY1n3Ppc7g and an offset modifier of 6. Figure 11.0. Base64 decryption routine The decryption routine can be written in Python as follows CIPHER_TEXT  _BqwHaF8TkKDMfOzQASx4VuXdZibUIeylJWhj0m5o2ErLt6vGRN9sY1n3Ppc7g-C OFFSET  6 def ceasar_decryptencoded, keyCIPHER_TEXT, offsetOFFSET return .joinkeykey.indexencoffset  0x3f if enc in key else enc for enc in encoded By writing an IDA Python script to use the above decryption function on the first set of strings, we are able to reveal strings used by the backdoor for its keylogging routine and other functionalities. Figure 11.1. Decrypted Keylogging Strings. Decryption 2 The second set of encrypted strings are decoded with RC4 using the following cipher key 3F738FEA334633468BA981AFE2C1A8E8 Using another IDA Python script to decrypt the second set of strings reveals the backdoors Command  Control CC configuration.

Outdated software, operating systems, browsers, and plugins are major vectors for malware infections. Deploy Cloud-Based Email Gateway Protection from a Security Provider Cloud-based Secure Email Gateways add more advanced security like time-of-click URL analysis and protection from attacks. Deploy a Web Security Gateway An effective web security gateway will block access to malicious sites, as well as stop new and zero-day malware downloads and communications with botnet CC servers. Train Users to Not Enable Always Allow on Adobe Acrobat By enabling always allow in Adobe Acrobat users risk the automatic download of malicious files.
