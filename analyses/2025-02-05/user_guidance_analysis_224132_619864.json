Never click on suspicious links claiming to be from Phantom. Ensure the URL is correct to avoid phishing attacks.\n\n2. **Private Key Security**: Treat your private keys with utmost care. Store them offline in a secure location like a hardware wallet. Never share your private key with anyone.\n\n3. **Strong Passwords**: Use unique and complex passwords for all accounts. Consider using a password manager to securely store and manage your passwords.\n\n4. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enable 2FA wherever available to add an extra layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain access.\n\n5. **Browser Security**: Use a secure, updated browser and regularly clear browsing data to mitigate risks of session hijacking.\n\n6. **Network Safety**: Avoid using public Wi-Fi for transactions.
