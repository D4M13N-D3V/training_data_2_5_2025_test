Also enormous? The 78 of Microsoft 365 administrators who reported successful security breaches, citing email phishing as the leading cause.

Its native security has a 16 false negative rate for spam and phishing emails, according to Mimecast. If a scammer uses a spoofedlookalikesoundalike domain that doesnt exactly match your domain name, Microsoft 365 wont flag the activity. It also wont flag spoofed domains for your business partners or even well-known brands. Saleforce.com will still go through. Microsoft 365 uses static blacklists when scanning URLs for threats. Meanwhile phishing sites can have short life spans, even just a few hours. Analyzing each site in real time is a far stronger form of prevention. And Microsoft 365 has features such as Safe Attachments , which uses virtual sandboxing to scan attachments in an email. But sophisticated threats require deeper inspection of embedded documents and code.
