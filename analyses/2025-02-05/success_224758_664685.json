Here we have an email posing to have an order of masks. An important personal protection equipment that is on a very high demand as of this moment. Infection Chain Overview RTF Attachment Once the file is opened, it will try to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Word to download and execute a file. hxxpbit.ly2J9KXAM which resolves to hxxpposqit.netGE5091203.jpg 5091203.jpg The downloaded .jpg file is actually a PE Executable file. It is a .NET file so we can use DnSpy to analyze its code. Once executed, it will decrypt a DLL fileDKaQso.dll using AES from its resource and will load and execute it using Assembly.Load and InvokeMember methods. Resource section object named AL is the encrypted DKaQso.dll. Key and IV used to decrypt the file Execute X on DKaQso.dll DKaQso.dll The DLL file contains another 3 files in its resource. The 2 image files contain 1 DLL file each. 1.bmp - LOL.dll which is embedded in an image. SourceTIASK .bmp- 26.dll. which is compressed and embedded in image. IsConsoleEnabledsANCK - AgentTesla binary payload which is compressed and encrypted. It uses the Bitmap Class to get the embedded DLL in the BMP file which is a form of Steganography.Here we have an image of a snippet code which gets the first pixel and get the color.B property.The byte is equal to 0x4D which is equal to M, the start of the MZ header in PE files.It will perform a loop on each pixel and get the byte in the color.B property to form the the DLL file. In the case of 26.dll, once the file is taken out of the image, it will be decompressed. LOL.dll Once loaded and executed, the files task is to create a persistence mechanism for the malware. It checks for files and folders related to Anti-Malware vendors and creates the necessary files for its persistence mechanism. If the following files exist in the system, it will create .js file in the startup folder CProgram FilesAVAST SoftwareAvastavastUI.exe CProgram Files x86AVAST SoftwareAvastavastUI.exe CProgram FilesAVGAntivirusAVGUI.exe CProgram Files x86AVGAntivirusAVGUI.exe Content of the .js file var nPiCCaK  new ActiveXObjectShell.Application nPiCCaK.ShellExecuteMALWARE PATH, , , Open, 1 If the following folder exist in the system, it will create a shortcut link in the startup folder. CProgram Files x86KasperSky Lab FilesKasperSky Lab - folder path contains the string If windows Windows Defender exist in the system, it will create a registry entry that is linked to the malware executable path SOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun 26.dll This DLL is responsible for injecting the payload on Regasm.exe. It checks for the following directory related to Anti-Malware vendors CProgram FilesAVAST Software CProgram Files x86AVAST Software It also checks for the following strings related to Anti-Malware vendors BullGuard a2guard drweb vssery AVGUI bdagent odscanui bdredline It also checks for Windows Defender Payload The main payload of this infection chain is a variant of AgentTesla. The strings used by this malware is encrypted using AES. Using the info of its decryption routine,we can try and decrypt the strings it uses. Here we have the SMTP account and server it uses.
