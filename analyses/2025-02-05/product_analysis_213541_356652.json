Ransomware helps cyber criminals generate income by blackmailing the victim and demanding them to pay for data recovery. Ransomware has transformed from its beginnings of automatic attacks into human-operated, targeted campaigns with sophisticated strategies. Gartner forecasts that 75 of IT organizations experience an attack by 2025.
