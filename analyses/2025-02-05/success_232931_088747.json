    "content": "### Security Guidance for Preventing Business Email Compromise (BEC) Attacks\n\n**1. Security Best Practices:**\n   - **Verify Requests:** Always confirm financial requests through a phone call using a number not in the email. Verify with your supervisor or IT if unsure.\n   - **Check Email Sources:** Look for slight email address variations. Hover over links to see the URL before clicking.\n   - **Use Out-of-Office (OOO) Detection:** Employ tools to flag emails from unknown senders.\n   - **Secure Accounts:** Enable MFA and use strong, unique passwords.\n\n**2. Data Protection Recommendations:**\n   - **Limit Access:** Grant permissions only to necessary personnel on a need-to-know basis.\n   - **Backup Data:** Schedule regular backups to prevent data loss from ransomware.\n   - **Encrypt Sensitive Information:** Use encryption for sensitive data shared via email or cloud.\n\n**3. Safe Usage Guidelines:**\n   - **Avoid Suspicious Links/Attachments:** Refrain from opening links or attachments from unknown senders.\n   - **Use Approved Tools:** Use only official communication channels for sensitive discussions.\n\n**4. Common Risks and Prevention:**\n   - **Phishing/Social Engineering:** Attackers trick users into divulging info. Stay vigilant and report suspicious emails.\n   - **Malware:** Be cautious with links and attachments. Install antivirus and back up data.\n   - **Insider Threats:** Monitor access logs and enforce strict policies.\n\n**5. Privacy Protection Measures:**\n   - **Anonymize Data:** Remove personal info from non-sensitive data.\n   - **Adjust Privacy Settings:** Limit data sharing on platforms.\n   - **Secure Communication:** Use end-to-end encrypted channels for sensitive info.\n\n**6. When to Seek Additional Support:**\n   - Report suspicious emails to IT immediately.\n   - Inform IT of any unauthorized access.\n   - Request training and audits to stay updated on security practices.\n\nThis structured approach provides practical steps to prevent BEC attacks, emphasizing verification, awareness, and secure communication. Simple language ensures accessibility for all users, helping them implement these measures effectively.",
