While much of our competition continues to struggle to attain market traction and uses inflated non externally validated user counts, our active user base is monitored and published by WordPress itself. 30,000 active installations are not easy to create, maintain or keep happy. We work hard daily to keep our users happy and engaged! We hope to grow to the same levels directly in the US-based marketplace as the CCPA, its forecasted changes that are coming up throughout the next 12-18 months, and of course, the myriad different state ones coming for years to come. The current state of the Covid-19 pandemic is more than a unique situation for personal privacy and governance compliance it represents a massive and growing opportunity for Data443 to assume a leading position for data security and privacy. Privacy compliancy enforcement is proceeding in California with no deferrals and other states are proceeding as well. The risks to personal privacy with COVID-19 and return to work activities continue to reinforce the requirements for legislation frameworks and more importantly  simple, fast to deploy and cost-efficient toolsets for business owners to adopt and utilize. We expect these requirements to grow in complexity and volume as 2020 continues, and we continue to deliver solutions to meet these challenges for our clients, added Mr. Remillard.
