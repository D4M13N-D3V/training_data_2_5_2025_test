Data443 or the Company OTCPK ATDS, a leading data security and privacy software company, today announced the completion of the acquisition of certain assets from Centurion Technologies, namely its ransomware protection and device recovery technologies, along with ancillary assets. The deal brings to Data443  the leading technical component to comply with recently established requirements from the Cybersecurity  Infrastructure Security Agency CISA, as mandated by the Biden Administration. Trusted by customers worldwide with over 3 million licenses deployed, Centurion will deliver valuable intellectual property and patents, customers, and extensive partner portfolio and integrations to Data443. Data security ransomware and theft continue unabated in 2022, and the demand has never been more robust for capabilities that protect data, devices, and critical infrastructure. Simplistic recovery for end-users is considered a major milestone for technology vendors  greatly reducing the reliance on expensive and increasingly unavailable IT staff Data443s Ransomware Recovery Manager  enables users to recover from any attack with a simple reboot. Our staff and partners are very excited for this next phase of the product line, stated the outgoing president of Centurion Technologies, Tripp Manheimer. Little did we know that being part of Operation Enduring Freedom, helping several branches of the US armed forces, along with hundreds of schools, universities, medical and financial institutions that utilize our protection and recovery services, would continue to contribute to such an important and germane capability for this time and age. Jason Remillard, Data443s Founder and Chief Executive Officer, commented, This acquisition represents a major milestone for Data443 and demonstrates once again that Data443 continues to make headway even in challenging market conditions. Centurions ransomware recovery product has long been a differentiator since we first licensed it in 2021 for our product line. Ransomware victims have very little recourse after an attack in fact, the government has initiated efforts to stifle ransom payments using cryptocurrency. Investments in best-practice security programs, platforms, and frameworks have become a business necessity. Completing this transaction adds immediate value to our clients and significantly boosts our capabilities and technology stack. At the same time, Data443 is acquiring a satisfied, robust customer list that will allow us to introduce our full suite of products and services. Centurions customers can now look forward to updated product releases, including new features like our recently released Antivirus Protect Manager  , local data sensitivity scanning, and data exfiltration protection to support zero-trust models that many clients are currently pursuing, concluded Mr. Remillard.
