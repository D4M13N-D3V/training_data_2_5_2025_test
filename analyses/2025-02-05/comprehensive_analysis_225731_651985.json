We addressed FIDO Fast IDentity Online last year in this series. If you remember FIDO is an authentication technology developed back in 2013 with the stated goal of replacing passwords. FIDO was founded to develop technical specifications to improve the interoperability and adoption of various hardware-based authentication techniques. The original standard was made up of two sets of specifications or user experiences for authentication  UAF Universal Authentication Framework and U2F Universal Second Factor. UAF deals with passwordless authentication, while U2F addresses the second factor authentication, typically with a Yubico type of token. FIDO2 is new for 2018 and it is quite exciting. The term is a shorthand for the combination of two developing standards, W3Cs WebAuthn and FIDOs CTAP Client to Authenticator Protocol standard. These new standard would not be very useful if they did not come with platform support, and since this one intends to bridge the desktop world with the mobile world, browsers and operating systems are both critical. Luckily, this one had extra time in the standards oven more than 2 years and it came out fairly fully-baked with Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Android  Windows 10 supporting the standard now or later in 2018. Apple is now part of the WebAuthN working group, so there are high hopes they will join the party, but mums the word at this moment. So why is this important, and why does Resilient care? Weve been implementing the newest authentication techniques for our clients for years most recently adding U2F tokens for admins for a healthcare cloud company but we dont like to limit customers to only certain supporting browsers. Standards are cumbersome and slow, but excellent when a good design is adopted widely. In this case FIDO2 is just better multi-factor than other options because it removes many of the common security threats including phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks and misuse of credentials, and since a users credential never leaves the users authenticator it is much more difficult to steal the credential. That being said, it has not been entirely smooth sailing for FIDO. Microsoft skipped the original FIDO standard but now they support WebAuthN, Apple is a big question mark, and many implementers in the industry have been on the sidelines waiting for more clarity on the communication options for U2F NFC, BLE and migration from USB-A to USB-C. Also, the industry has seen a lot of adoption of other MFA in the past five years and good enough MFA though still vulnerable to intercept or carrier hacks has become an impediment to the better FIDO2 approach. Cost and complexity are the final, and most important, drag on adoption. FIDO2  WebAuthN is a big stride in the right direction. It is targeting a broader scope of authentication problems and doing so with a longer list of compatible platforms. We believe that the tipping point for FIDO2 will happen, but exactly when is anyones guess. We expect more announcements on FIDO2 in 2018 a free mobile authenticator from Google, perhaps so watch our blog for the latest.

  "analysis": "**Analysis of FIDO 2.0 for Cybersecurity**\n\n**1. Key Security Features and Benefits**\n\n- **Phishing Resistance**: FIDO 2.0 enhances security by ensuring credentials remain on the device, reducing the risk of phishing attacks.\n- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Supports both passwordless and second-factor authentication, strengthening security across various platforms.\n- **Platform Interoperability**: Operates seamlessly across browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) and operating systems (Android, Windows 10), with potential support from Apple, allowing widespread adoption.\n\n**2. Compliance and Regulatory Adherence**\n\nWhile not explicitly stated, FIDO 2.0 likely aids in meeting compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS by providing robust authentication methods, which are often required for regulatory compliance.\n\n**3. User-Focused Security Recommendations**\n\n- **Enable FIDO2**: Activate FIDO 2.0 authentication wherever possible to enhance security.\n- **Use Authenticator Apps/Security Keys**: Adopt apps or keys for added protection, especially for sensitive accounts.\n- **Keep Software Updated**: Regular updates ensure the latest security patches and features are in place.\n\n**4. Technical Implementation Details**\n\n- **WebAuthn and CTAP**: Utilizes WebAuthn for browser-based authentication and CTAP for device comunications, enabling passwordless and second-factor authentication respectively.\n- **Encryption**: Likely employs encryption to protect data during transmission, enhancing security.\n\n**5. Data Protection Measures**\n\n- **Credential Isolation**: Credentials remain on the device, mitigating interception risks.\n- **Encryption**: Protects data during transmission, adding another layer of security.\n\n**6. Best Practices for End Users**\n\n- **Adopt MFA**: Enable multi-factor authentication to bolster account security.\n- **Use Security Keys**: Consider using physical security keys for enhanced protection.\n- **Stay Informed**: Keep abreast of updates and new authenticator tools for optimal security.\n\n**Challenges and Considerations**\n\n- **Adoption Hurdles**: Slow adoption from major players like Apple and cost barriers for organizations may hinder widespread use.\n- **Industry Shift**: Transitioning from existing MFA methods to FIDO 2.0 may pose challenges due to cost and complexity.\n\nIn conclusion, FIDO 2.0 represents a significant advancement in authentication security, offering robust features and benefits. While challenges remain, its adoption promises enhanced security and compliance across various platforms."
