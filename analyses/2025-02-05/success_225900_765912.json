A user or organizations data is first encrypted. This way, they cannot access their confidential files, databases, or applications. After this, a ransom is demanded so that the cybercriminal will provide access. Ransomware is typically designed to spread across networks  targeting database and file servers. It can thus quickly paralyze entire organizations. Ransomware is a growing threat, but it still generates billions of dollars in payments to cybercriminals each year  inflicting significant damage to businesses and government organizations .
