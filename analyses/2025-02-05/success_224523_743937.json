January 31, 2019 The General Data Protection Act GDPR launched a worldwide conversation on data security and consumer data protections. As historical data breaches continue to happen on a way-too-frequent basis, and data privacy legislation expands across the globe, companies are taking a harder look at their privacy policies and their obligations under each law. Each regulation has different requirements, from e-mail marketing to sale of personal data, but the options consumers have remain the same. California Consumer Privacy Act While the final details of the law that becomes effective January, 1, 2020 might still be fine turned, the overall requirements will remain. Of these, the act requires businesses and websites that fall under the law to provide consumers the option to opt-out of the sale of their information. This raises the question  is there an advantage to opt-in vs opt-out? Opt-in or Opt-out? Opting-in gives the consumer the choice to check an unfilled box, opting-in to receive your e-mail communications, allow for information to be shared with other partner companies, etc. When a consumer opts in they are telling you, Yes, I agree that my information is shared with . whatever the terms you have spelled out. Requiring consumers to opt-out places the responsibility to decide whether to allow the sale of their personal information up front, before continuing on a website or making a purchase on an app. The method here is the consumer expressly saying, No, you may not share my information in any way. You may pre-check the box and require consumers to uncheck it in order to opt-out. Opting-Out ROI impact with e-mail marketing Opt-out email subscriptions may devalue the quality of your contacts, and will ultimately decrease your return on investment ROI in certain areas like e-mail marketing. Some consumers that are not expecting your email may mark it as spam, potentially increasing your overall risk of being spam filtered out of future correspondence. In addition, most mass email services charge based on the number of e-mails being sent. If you are looking for the highest engagement and ROI, having a list of 5,000 consumers receiving emails where 1,000 engage, your return is far better than having 50,000 consumers with 2,000 actively engaging. Ultimately, if you collect consumer information and are regulated by any privacy law, the best practice to prevent noncompliance is to require consumers to expressly opt-in PRIOR TO the entry point of data collection.

    "content": "**Security Advisor's Guidance on Data Protection and Privacy**\n\n---\n\n**1. Understanding Regulatory Requirements**\n\n- **GDPR and CCPA Overview**: Familiarize your organization with regulations like GDPR and CCPA, which mandate user consent for data collection and protection. Understand that non-compliance can lead to significant penalties.\n\n**2. Opt-In vs. Opt-Out: Choosing the Right Model**\n\n- **Opt-In Model**: Recommend using opt-in as it requires explicit user consent, ensuring compliance and higher engagement. Though it may reduce sign-ups, it builds trust and adheres to legal standards.\n- **Opt-Out Model**: Recognize that opt-out increases contacts but risks lower engagement and potential spam issues. Ensure compliance if opting for this model, especially under regulations.\n\n**3. Best Practices for Data Handling**\n\n- **Explicit Consent**: Implement opt-in by default for data collection. Ensure users actively agree to terms, enhancing compliance and trust.\n- **Transparency**: Clearly inform users about data usage. Avoid pre-checked boxes; let users decide what they consent to.\n- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data. Offer clear opt-out options without penalties, respecting user autonomy.\n\n**4. Data Protection Strategies**\n\n- **Encryption**: Secure data both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (using AES encryption).\n- **Regular Audits**: Conduct audits to ensure compliance and update policies periodically.\n- **Incident Response Plan**: Establish a plan for data breaches, including notification procedures and damage control.\n\n**5. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n\n- **Employee Training**: Educate staff on handling sensitive data securely.\n- **Access Control**: Restrict data access to necessary personnel to minimize breach risks.\n- **Strong Security Practices**: Enforce strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n\n**6. Identifying and Mitigating Risks**\n\n- **Common Risks**: Be aware of phishing, breaches, and non-compliance. Train users to recognize phishing attempts.\n- **Preventive Measures**: Use encryption, regular audits, and user education to address risks.\n\n**7. Privacy Protection Measures**\n\n- **Respect User Preferences**: Honor opt-out requests promptly and ensure easy access for users to manage their data.\n- **Data Subject Rights**: Allow users to access, correct, or delete their data, and provide clear instructions.\n- **Policy Reviews**: Regularly update privacy policies to align with legal changes.\n\n**8. Seeking Additional Support**\n\n- **Consult Experts**: If handling significant personal data or operating in regulated industries, consult data protection professionals.\n- **Breach Response**: Engage experts during a breach to mitigate damage and ensure compliance.\n\n**9. Conclusion and Action**\n\n- **Summary**: Prioritize opt-in models, transparency, and user control. Use encryption, limit data collection, and educate users.\n- **Call to Action**: Review current practices, consider consulting experts, and stay informed about regulatory updates.\n\n---\n\nThis guidance provides a structured approach to enhancing data security and privacy, emphasizing practical steps and compliance to build trust and mitigate risks.",
