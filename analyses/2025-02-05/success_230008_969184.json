The presence of the EncryptedPackage stream in an OLE2 document indicates that it is protected by a password, which obviously would require the user to enter one in order to open the document properly. Or at least thats what the bad guys would like email or AV scanners to think. Figure 1 Looking at the e-mail, which is couched as a very generic price quote request, the sender did not provide any password for the attachment, so what gives? Figure 2 Sounds like something weve already seen a few years back, six years to be exact. Do you remember VelvetSweatshop and the infamous CVE-2012-0158 exploit which took advantage of the Microsoft Excel default password hidden feature to evade detection? Well, this malware campaign will surely bring you back to those old days. First lets try to open the document to see if Microsoft Office will be able to load it properly. Figure 3 Figure 4 And sure thing, Microsoft Office Excel was able to open the document with no problems at alland no request to enter a password. So lets take a look at whats happening in the background. Exploits Office Vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 The first thing youll notice is the presence of EQNEDT32.EXE being loaded by svchost.exe. This behavior indicates a possible exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability. Figure 5 Digging a little deeper, we debugged the exploit shellcode to see what this document really does in the background. Sure enough, this sample does indeed exploit CVE-2017-11882 and attempts to download and execute an executable payload supposedly saved as PUBLICvbc.exe in the affected computers system, as shown in the screenshots below. Figure 6 Figure 7 VelvetSweatshop Default Password Ploy Still Being Used We also decrypted the email attachment and confirmed that this document is taking advantage of the old Microsoft Office hidden feature that uses a default password to load encrypted documents, as shown in the lines of code in the screenshot below. Figure 8 Unfortunately, the download link from this exploit sample was inaccessible as of this writing, so we are not able to provide an analysis of its payload.

    "content": "**Comprehensive Guide to Protecting Against the Excel Exploit (CVE-2017-11882)**\n\n**1. Keep Software Updated:**\n   - Enable automatic updates for Microsoft Office and other software to ensure patches are applied without manual intervention.\n   - Regularly check for updates if automatic updates aren't enabled.\n\n**2. Use Antivirus Software:**\n   - Install reputable antivirus software and ensure it's updated with the latest threat signatures.\n   - Use scans to regularly check for and remove malware.\n\n**3. Enhance User Awareness:**\n   - Educate users to be cautious with emails from unknown senders, especially those with generic or urgent content.\n   - Conduct training sessions on spotting phishing emails and suspicious attachments.\n\n**4. Monitor System Processes:**\n   - Use endpoint detection and response tools to monitor for unusual process activity, such as unexpected behavior from svchost.exe or EQNEDT32.EXE.\n\n**5. Implement Strong Password Practices:**\n   - Avoid using default passwords; set strong, unique passwords for all documents and accounts.\n   - Educate users about the risks of relying on hidden features or default settings.\n\n**6. Practice Safe Computing Habits:**\n   - Avoid opening attachments from untrusted sources unless necessary.\n   - Use Microsoft's Protected View to open potentially risky files in a sandboxed environment.\n   - Refrain from enabling macros in documents from unknown senders.\n\n**7. Utilize Backup Solutions:**\n   - Regularly back up critical data and store backups securely, both offsite and encrypted, to prevent data loss in case of an attack.\n\n**8. Leverage Cloud-Based Security:**\n   - Consider using cloud-based email security services that scan attachments for threats before delivery.\n\n**9. Develop an Incident Response Plan:**\n   - Train users on steps to take if a suspicious file is opened: disconnect from the internet, avoid opening other files, and contact IT support immediately.\n\n**10. Seek Professional Support:**\n   - If an attack is suspected or confirmed, seek assistance from IT or cybersecurity professionals to mitigate and remediate the threat.\n\nBy following these guidelines, users can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to such exploits and enhance their overall security posture.",
