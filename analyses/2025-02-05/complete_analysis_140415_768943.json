However, since the product focuses on email security and data protection, it is reasonable to assume that the solution aligns with common regulations. \n\n*Recommendation*: Clearly state the compliance certifications and regulatory standards the product adheres to. For example:\n  - \"Cyren IPM is GDPR-compliant, ensuring your data is protected according to the highest EU standards.\"\n  - \"Our solution meets HIPAA requirements for secure email communication in healthcare.\"\n\nWithout this information, users may be left uncertain about the solution's ability to meet their regulatory obligations.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **User-Focused Security Recommendations**\nThe content emphasizes \"enhanced email security\" and \"fast setup,\" but it does not provide actionable guidance for users.
