The emails are disguised as voice message notifications sent by Peach Telecom, which suggests that the campaign is targeting users in the UK. HTA files are loaded by the system using the program MSHTA.exe, and are executed by instantiating the Internet Explorer rendering engine MSHTML along with the required script engines such as jscript.dll and vbscript.dll. Opening the HTA file in a text editor shows use of the JScript language, which is used in most of the Locky campaigns. Cyren detects this downloader script variant as JSLocky.AY. Deobfuscating part of the code shows a decryption code structure similar to what we saw in the previous Locky samples we have analyzed. Each sample has at least four URLs from which it tries to download, and as usual the downloader script decrypts before executing. Similar to the variant we reported last week , the decrypted ransomware component is a DLL file and is loaded using rundll32.exe. We also observed that it no longer uses a code parameter along with the called export function. CYREN detects the decrypted DLL as W32Locky.IA. And just like the previously reported variant, this ransomware component finds and encrypts files in the affected system, renaming the files and appending the string .zepto as the file extension. Listed below are the files which are searched for and encrypted by this variant. .n64 .ltx .gif .c .lay .xltx .pdf .m4a .litesql .raw .php .ms11 Security copy .xltm .XLS .m4u .litemod .cgm .ldf .ms11 .xlsx .PPT .m3u .lbf .jpeg .mdf .sldm .xlsm .stw .mid .iwi .jpg .ibd .sldx .xlsb .sxw .wma .forge .tif .MYI .ppsm .slk .ott .flv .das .tiff .MYD .ppsx .xlw .odt .3g2 .d3dbsp .NEF .frm .ppam .xlt .DOC .mkv .bsa .psd .odb .docb .xlm .pem .3gp .bik .cmd .dbf .mml .xlc .p12 .mp4 .asset .bat .db .sxm .dif .csr .mov .apk .sh .mdb .otg .stc .crt .avi .gpg .class .sql .odg .sxc .key .asf .aes .jar .SQLITEDB .uop .ots wallet.dat .mpeg .ARC .java .SQLITE3 .potx .ods .vob .PAQ .rb .011 .potm .hwp .mpg .tar.bz2 .asp .010 .pptx .602 .wmv .tbk .cs .009 .pptm .dotm .fla .bak .brd .008 .std .dotx .swf .tar .sch .007 .sxd .docm .wav .tgz .dch .006 .pot .docx .mp3 .gz .dip .005 .pps .DOT .qcow2 .7z .pl .004 .sti .3dm .vdi .rar .vbs .003 .sxi .max .vmdk .zip .vb .002 .otp .3ds .vmx .djv .js .001 .odp .xml .wallet .djvu .h .pst .wb2 .txt .upk .svg .asm .onetoc2 .123 .CSV .sav .bmp .pas .asc .wks .uot .re4 .png .cpp .lay6 .wk1 .RTF After encrypting the files, the desktop wallpaper is replaced with the ransom instructions and the ransom instructions page is loaded. Clicking on the tor links redirects the users to the Locky decryptor page. While reviewing the domains of the download URLs, we found one particular domain, which was recently created and was registered using the email .
