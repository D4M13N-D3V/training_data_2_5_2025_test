      "user_guidance": "### Security Guidance: Protecting Yourself from Phishing Threats\n\n#### 1. Security Best Practices\n- **Verify Email Sources**: Always check the sender's email address for legitimacy. Look for slight misspellings or unusual domains.\n- **Use Antivirus Software**: Install reputable antivirus software and ensure regular updates for the latest protections.\n- **Keep Systems Updated**: Regularly update your operating system, browser, and other software to patch vulnerabilities.\n- **Strong Passwords and MFA**: Use complex passwords and enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) wherever possible.\n- **Be Cautious with Links/Attachments**: Avoid clicking on suspicious links or opening attachments from unknown sources.\n\n#### 2. Data Protection Recommendations\n- **Backup Data Regularly**: Schedule regular backups to an external drive or cloud storage to prevent data loss.\n- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use encryption for sensitive information to protect it from unauthorized access.\n- **Access Control**: Limit access to data only to those who need it, reducing the risk of internal breaches.\n- **Data Loss Prevention Tools**: Consider using tools that monitor and prevent unauthorized data transfers.\n\n#### 3. Safe Usage Guidelines\n- **Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Transactions**: Refrain from accessing sensitive accounts on public networks without a VPN.\n- **Use VPNs**: Virtual Private Networks encrypt your internet traffic, enhancing security on public networks.\n- **Spot Phishing Attempts**: Be alert for spelling mistakes, urgent requests, and generic greetings in emails.\n- **Block Suspicious Senders**: Report and block senders of phishing emails to reduce future risks.\n\n#### 4. Common Security Risks and Prevention\n- **Social Engineering**: Be wary of manipulative tactics. Verify requests through separate communication channels.\n- **Malware Awareness**: Recognize signs like slow performance or pop-ups. Install anti-malware and avoid suspicious downloads.\n\n#### 5. Privacy Protection Measures\n- **Regular Updates**: Ensure all devices and apps are updated to protect against known vulnerabilities.\n- **Privacy Settings**: Adjust settings in apps and social media to limit shared information.\n- **Privacy Tools**: Use VPNs and ad-blockers to minimize online tracking.\n\n#### 6.
