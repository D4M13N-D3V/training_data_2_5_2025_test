No. In our current version the popup only records that a user accepts that they know the site uses cookies. The cookie descriptions should be listed in the privacy policy page. How is this plugin difference from the privacy tools in WordPress? The privacy tools in WordPress only allow you to manually handle requests. Our plugin can automate the process. Additionally, the plugin also allows for custom consent types. Can I create custom consents for different parts of my website? Yes! Any number of consent checkboxes can be created and tracked for use with forms, newsletter sign-ups, surveys and more. Can I change the look and feel of the cookie acceptance popup? Yes. The plugin allows for some customization. What is the difference between delete and anonymize my data? Delete will fully remove a user from the database. Anonymize will remove any private information for field setup to be anonymous. Information is removed, but some information in the database remains. Can users download a copy of their private information? Yes. Users can download an HTML or JSON copy of their private information stored on the website. Will the GDPR Framework automatically generate a privacy page for me? Yes. The plugin will generate a privacy policy page. To complete the page, a web administrator must complete any policy information unique to the business. These are marked with To-Do. Does the GDPR Framework accept requests to not sell a users private information? Yes. A shortcode is available to add a form so users can opt out. A record of submissions is available as a custom post type in the administration area of WordPress. Does the GDPR Framework offer free support? Yes. Support requests can be submitted through the Data443 support page and a specialist will help you with your issue. Can the GDPR Framework scan other servers and devices for a users private information? Yes, but this feature is not available in the free version of the plugin. Data443s Data Identification Manager solution has the ability to connect to services like Office 365, Sharepoint, Salesforce and more. Can I show my user that I am compliant with current privacy regulations? Yes. The plugin offers a free seal available for businesses to place on their site. This seal is updated in-real-time and confirms daily that your site is compliance with current privacy policies.
