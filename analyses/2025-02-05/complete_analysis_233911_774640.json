Jaff Ransomware Launched from Necurs Botnet May 15, 2017 Despite WannaCrypt grabbing all the headlines, it is far from being the only ransomware in circulation. A second wave of Jaff ransomware is now being distributed by the stealthy Necurs botnet. Starting on Monday, May 8 around 930 UTC, the Necurs botnet was harnessed to distribute a new Locky-style email campaign with an initial global outbreak of around 20 million emails. Cyren saw and blocked about 50 million Jaff emails in less than 24 hours during a subsequent wave, and on Thursday approximately 65 million Jaff emails were detected and blocked. Locky Redux? There are signs that the same group responsible for Locky and Dridex are also at work here. Because of Necurs size and stealth, we predict that this attack campaign will be persistent and large-scale. Initial Locky distributions in Q1 2016 were about one-tenth the size of the later massive Locky outbreaks seen in Q4 2016  if this pattern holds true, and this is a merely timid beginning by Jaff, future volumes will be enormous. What is the difference between WannaCrypt and Jaff? In both WannaCrypt and Jaff the criminal motives are the same, extorting victims for money by holding files for ransom. However, while keeping your operating system up-to-date with the latest security patches may get you out of being infected by WannaCrypt, there is no guarantee of such protection in most ransomware campaigns. The vulnerability Jaff exploits is the human factor, and user action is always required for the attack to work. Compared to other ransomware campaigns, Jaff is asking an unusually high ransom payment, approximately 3,800 per infection. The highly profiled WannaCrypt asks for 300, increasing to 600 if the ransom has not been paid after a week. How does Jaff work? Jaff is distributed with an email campaign sent from the Necurs botnet. Typically, such emails contain a message body designed to trick the user into opening the attachment, but here Jaff differs. The email contains only an attachment and the message body is either blank or just has the name of the attachment  we assume to make users curious enough to simply open the attachment. In the first attack, the emails had names like Document_random number.pdf and Scan_random number.pdf. Subsequent outbreaks mainly used attachment names with only numbers. The attached PDF has an embedded docm file  a document file containing a macro. Depending on the version of Adobe, the document will either prompt the user to open the embedded doc, or it will automatically launch MS Word. Once opened, the user is prompted to enable editing and content. Hyper-Evasive Tactics Varied in Every Wave to Evade Detection The attackers vary all parts of the attack during each wave to make detection of the emails and various files more complex The names of the files and the email subjects are randomly changed The order of actions taken by the pdf script is changed The Word macro that constructs the download link and downloads the file is different in each variant The download links are changed Macro Downloads Ransomware After being enabled, the macro downloads the Jaff ransomware executable file from one of a list of hardcoded URLs as seen in the picture below, in this specific case djkammerthal.dehHGFjd. The downloaded binary is decrypted by the macro, installed and executed. First, the program connects to a CC server to let the attackers know of a new infection.  ... method GET, host h552terriddows.com, uri a5, ... status_code 201, status_msg Created,  Excerpt from the CC check-in. File Formats Encrypted After check-in, the encryption of files on the victim computer starts. Encryption using RSA-2048 key AES CBC 256-bit encryption algorithm is used and a .jaff extension is appended to the encrypted files.

      "product": "### Detailed Analysis of the Security Features and Capabilities of the Jaff Ransomware Campaign\n\n#### 1. Key Security Features and Capabilities:\n- **Email-Based Distribution**: The ransomware is spread through a massive email campaign leveraging the Necurs botnet, which is known for its stealth and scalability. The emails often contain malicious PDF attachments with embedded Word documents (docm files) that include macros.\n  \n- **Macro-Based Malware Execution**: The ransomware relies on social engineering to trick users into enabling macros in Word documents. Once enabled, the macro downloads the ransomware executable from predefined URLs, which can vary between waves to evade detection.\n\n- **Advanced Encryption**: Jaff uses a combination of RSA-2048 for key encryption and AES CBC 256-bit for file encryption. This dual-layer encryption makes it highly sophisticated and difficult to decrypt without the attackers' private key.\n\n- **File Format Targeting**: The ransomware encrypts a wide range of file formats, including common Office documents, multimedia files, archives, and more specialized formats such as CAD files and databases.\n\n- **Evasion Techniques**: The attackers regularly change file names, email subjects, and download URLs to avoid detection by traditional signature-based security systems. The macro code is also obfuscated and varies between waves.\n\n- **Communication with Command & Control (C2) Servers**: After infection, the ransomware connects to a C2 server to report the infection, allowing the attackers to track the spread and manage ransom payments.\n\n#### 2. User Benefits and Protection Measures:\n- **Awareness of Social Engineering Tactics**: Users should be vigilant about unsolicited emails with attachments, especially those that prompt them to enable macros. This awareness can significantly reduce the risk of infection.\n\n- **Backup and Recovery Preparedness**: Regular backups of critical data can mitigate the impact of a ransomware attack. In the event of an infection, users can restore their files without paying the ransom.\n\n- **Patch Management**: While Jaff primarily exploits the human factor rather than software vulnerabilities, keeping software up-to-date is a general best practice to reduce the attack surface.\n\n#### 3. Integration with Existing Security Systems:\n- **Email Filtering**: Advanced email security solutions can detect and block malicious emails based on behavioral analysis, attachment type, and known indicators of compromise (IOCs). For example, email gateways can block emails with suspicious attachments or macro-enabled documents.\n\n- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: Endpoint security solutions with behavior-based detection can identify and block the execution of malicious macros and ransomware binaries.\n\n- **Network Traffic Monitoring**: Network security tools can monitor for unusual traffic patterns, such as unexpected connections to known or unknown C2 servers.\n\n#### 4. Compliance and Certification Details:\n- **Data Protection Regulations**: Organizations affected by ransomware attacks must comply with data protection regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or others, depending on the industry and geographical location. Implementing security measures to prevent ransomware infections is part of compliance with these regulations.\n\n- **Incident Response Plans**: Organizations should have incident response plans in place to handle ransomware attacks, including containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities.\n\n#### 5. Security Best Practices for Users:\n- **Avoid Opening Suspicious Emails**: Users should never open attachments or enable macros from unsolicited emails, especially if the email is blank or seems unusual.\n\n- **Use Antivirus and Anti-Malware Tools**: Ensure endpoints are protected with up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware solutions that can detect and block known ransomware variants.\n\n- **Implement User Education and Training**: Regular security awareness training can help users identify phishing emails and avoid falling victim to social engineering tactics.\n\n- **Regular Backups**: Maintain regular, secure backups of critical data, preferably in an offline or air-gapped environment, to ensure quick recovery in case of an attack.\n\n#### 6. Technical Specifications and Requirements:\n- **Supported Platforms**: Jaff ransomware primarily targets Windows systems, as it relies on Windows-based macros and Office applications.\n\n- **Network Requirements**: The ransomware requires internet connectivity to communicate with C2 servers and download additional components. Network segmentation and monitoring can help detect and block these communications.\n\n- **Processor and Memory Requirements**: While specific technical requirements for the ransomware itself are not detailed, the encryption process may impact system performance, particularly on systems with large amounts of data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Jaff ransomware campaign highlights the importance of a multi-layered security approach, combining advanced email filtering, endpoint protection, user education, and robust backup strategies. Organizations must also ensure that their security measures are integrated, compliant with relevant regulations, and capable of detecting and mitigating evolving threats like Jaff.",
