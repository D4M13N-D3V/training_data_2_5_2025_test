Instead of bringing good tidings, it turns out that a whopping 78 of emails this past week with the word Christmas in the subject line are spam. Considering that Cyren inspects billions of emails every day, thats a lot of lumps of coal in inboxes. And it should surprise no one that emails containing links to fake shopping sites are also clogging your inbox this time of year, with the fashion spam category leading the way, trying to induce well-meaning gift givers to visit fake web sites like sneakernnz.com fake Nike, bootskest.com fake UGG, and baggoingdae.com fake Michael Kors. A spam attack this week for the fake Michael Kors shopping site ranks as the highest volume non-malware attack seen by Cyrens security cloud this year , that is to say, 1 for attacks not involving malicious email attachments its hard to compete with nearly 40 billion Locky ransomware-infected email attachments distributed in a single day. These sites wont infect your computer, theyll just steal your money. Traditional ransomware distribution volumes, by the way, are not up at all  which is actually not good news, since they continue at their normal, torrid pace. It only shows that the criminal gangs behind them dont take a holiday during the holidays. Want to learn more about cloud-delivered web security? Contact us here !
