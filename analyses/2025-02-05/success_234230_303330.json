At the core of this new release is functionality that we are calling contextual access control . We believe that to securely share data and connect organizations we need to go beyond todays narrow definition of identity to a broader understanding, one that is focused on context. Organizations today are in a tricky spot. They fully acknowledge that the world has become digital, and that to be competitive they must connect and collaborate with outside parties. On the other hand, sharing resources with partners and customers is inherently risky. Many still feel that the security concerns outweigh the benefits. Others use Identity and Access Management IAM systems that were built for internal sharing, and use identity, provisioned by a single entity as the root of trust. Going beyond identity to focus on context however, allows us to reimagine IAM for the connected world. Contextual access control offers a way for organizations to gather enough context to form a more complete picture of these external parties. Fundamentally, the more you know about the context of an access request the more likely you are to make the correct access decision. Contextual access is about connecting to data sources so that we can answer sophisticated questions before granting access. These questions fall into the following categories Subject  What are the details about the person requesting access? Role, group memberships, department, company, certifications, biometrics etc. Action  What is the person attempting to do? Read, write, edit, download etc. Resource  What resource will be impacted by the action? Apps, docs, APIs, services etc. Environment  What is the environment of the request? Time, location, device type etc. Broadening the definition of what we mean by identity allows us to ask and answer questions like Is this a doctor? or Is this a trusted device? Interestingly we are seeing a number of industry experts who are also talking about context in the same breath as identity. For example, in a recent article Forresters VP and Principal Analyst, Andras Cser,  acser  defined identity as follows By identity, we mean a specific set of attributes that, when paired with the right context, and policy evaluation engine, allows the user to connect and access only the company data and apps that they are supposed to have access to.

    "content": "### Security Guidance Based on Contextual Access Control\n\n#### 1. Understand the Context Beyond Identity\nMove beyond traditional identity-based access control by considering the context of each access request. Evaluate four key areas:\n- **Subject:** Verify user details like role, department, and certifications. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an added security layer.\n- **Action:** Define clear permissions for actions such as read, write, or edit. Monitor unusual activities.\n- **Resource:** Ensure access aligns with the sensitivity and nature of the resource (e.g., APIs, documents).\n- **Environment:** Assess the context like time, location, and device used.\n\n#### 2. Implement Contextual Access Control\nAdopt systems that evaluate the broader context of access requests. This approach allows for informed decisions, balancing security with collaboration needs.\n\n#### 3. Data Protection Recommendations\n- **Classify Data:** Categorize data based on sensitivity and apply corresponding security measures.\n- **Encrypt Sensitive Information:** Use encryption for both in-transit and at-rest data to safeguard against breaches.\n\n#### 4. Safe Usage Guidelines\n- **Security Awareness Training:** Regularly educate users on threats and safe practices.\n- **Secure Devices:** Ensure all devices have updated security software and strong access controls.\n\n#### 5. Common Security Risks and Prevention\n- **Phishing Attacks:** Train users to recognize and report suspicious emails or messages.\n- **Insider Threats:** Monitor access logs and implement least privilege principles to prevent data misuse.\n\n#### 6. Privacy Protection Measures\n- **Data Minimization:** Collect only necessary data and ensure proper handling.\n- **Anonymization:** Use techniques like pseudonymization to protect identities where possible.\n\n#### 7. Seek Additional Security Support\nConsult experts for:\n- **Security Incidents:** External expertise is crucial during breaches or suspected threats.\n- **Compliance:** Ensure adherence to regulations like GDPR or CCPA.\n- **Complex Implementations:** Seek guidance for advanced security solutions.\n\nBy focusing on context and practical measures, organizations can enhance security while maintaining effective collaborations.",
