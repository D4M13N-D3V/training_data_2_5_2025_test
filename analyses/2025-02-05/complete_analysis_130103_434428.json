      "user_guidance": "Here is some clear and practical security guidance for end users:\n\nSecurity Best Practices\n1. Use strong, unique passwords for each account and enable multi-factor authentication where available.\n2. Keep all devices, operating systems, browsers and apps updated with the latest security patches. Enable automatic updates.\n3. Only download software and apps from trusted, official sources. Avoid downloading email attachments from unknown senders.\n4. Be cautious about links and attachments, even from known senders. Phishing attacks are common.\n\nData Protection \n1. Avoid storing sensitive data on devices or transferring it over email/messaging when possible. Use secure file sharing tools.\n2. Encrypt sensitive data, both at rest and in transit. Use built-in device encryption and encrypted connections (HTTPS, VPN, etc.)\n3. Securely delete data from devices before disposing of, selling or giving away old devices. Use secure erase tools.\n4. Back up important data regularly to protected storage. Test backups periodically.\n\nSafe Usage\n1. Avoid connecting to sensitive accounts or entering private data while on public Wi-Fi. Use cellular data or VPN.\n2. Lock devices when not in use. Use biometric locks or strong passcodes. Enable remote wipe capabilities.\n3. Be mindful of shoulder surfing in public spaces. Use privacy screens on devices.\n4. Limit sharing personal information online and on social media. Regularly check privacy settings.\n\nCommon Risks\n1. Phishing attacks trick you into revealing credentials. Verify requests through another channel before providing info.\n2. Malware can infect devices through malicious attachments, fake software downloads, compromised websites. Keep security software updated.\n3. Weak, reused or compromised passwords put accounts at risk. Use a password manager to maintain strong, unique passwords.\n4. Public Wi-Fi allows easy eavesdropping of traffic. Avoid sensitive activities on public networks.\n\nPrivacy Protection\n1. Give apps the minimum permissions necessary. Regularly audit app permissions. \n2. Opt out of ad personalization and data sharing where possible in app and device settings.\n3. Use privacy-respecting services that collect minimal data and offer end-to-end encryption.\n4. Be aware of the data collected by smart home devices, wearables, etc. Limit data sharing.\n\nWhen to Get Help\n1. If you suspect an account has been compromised, change passwords immediately and contact the provider.  \n2. If a device is infected with malware, disconnect it from networks and have it professionally cleaned.\n3. If you accidentally share sensitive info, notify relevant parties immediately to mitigate damage.\n4. When in doubt about a security issue, ask your IT/security team for guidance rather than risking a mistake.\n\nThe key is being proactive about security, keeping software updated, using strong unique passwords, encrypting data, limiting data sharing, and knowing when to get help. Small everyday precautions go a long way in staying safe."
