Related Microsoft 365 Is Wildly Successful and Profoundly Vulnerable  Heres Why One method of phishing is known as a Phishing URL. In this attack, you receive an email from Microsoft asking you to verify your credentials. The email looks completely normal, but what lurks behind the verify button isnt.

But youre only halfway there. When an email hits your email gateway, its scanned and then delivered to your inbox. The gateway checked the emails links against a database and the results came back clean. We can relax, right? What your SEG doesnt see? The verify your credentials email from Microsoft actually links to a cooking website. Since that site is real, the email sailed through.
