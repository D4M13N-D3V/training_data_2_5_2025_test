Heres how attackers use sophisticated tactics to bypass the SEG and trick users into taking the bait. Fooling the SEG Activating or uploading malicious content to a target web page only after the email has been scanned isnt a new scam. Advanced SEGs countered this tactic with time-of-click detection, which automatically rescans an email when the user clicks the link. It gives the SEG one last chance to detect a malicious URL. Related Block Evasive Phishing with Email Security Defense-in-Depth However, it is not without flaws. Spear phishing and Business Email Compromise BEC attacks dont contain URLs or attachments, so they appear harmless to the SEG. Once the tainted email has evaded the SEG, the user is the last line of defense. What it looks like Often a Business Email Compromise attack uses the organizations own internal communications to listen, learn, and execute a crime. The attacker might target and then observe the mailbox of a well-placed employee to learn when an executive is going on vacation, what payments are coming due, and who is responsible for vendor payments. This information can be used to plan a convincing wire fraud attack. Yes this happens. Fooling the user Evasion tactics trick users as well. 50 of users click on links because social engineering creates a sense of urgency, especially when cousin domains are used to obfuscate URLs Punycode attacks use foreign language characters that resemble English ones Attackers serve up local versions of a spoofed site, so the domain looks legitimate, but its not What it looks like Consider the employee who receives a vendor email saying a security vulnerability in the shadow application he is using has just been patched, so please click now to update and verify your ID. Not only does a counterfeit emailsite look and act like the real thing, it has all the expected security trappings. Even the most vigilant, security-trained users fall for these tricks. Fooling cybersecurity Bad actors even manage to evade detection by cybersecurity companies! They learn the IP address ranges of these companies and block the connection attempt. Or they change a couple of pixels in a fingerprinted image so tampering isnt detected. Target website HTML code is often obfuscated and encrypted. Its time to layer Inbox Detection and Response on top of SEGs Enterprises using cloud-hosted email urgently need an inner layer of email security called Inbox Detection and Response IDR. IDR solutions hook into users inboxes, and continuously scan all inbound and outbound emails in all folders. New from Cyren, this whitepaper provides best practices for implementing an IDR security layer. It explains how you can massively reduce the window of vulnerability caused by malicious emails lingering within the reach of users.

    "content": "### End-User Guidance on Data Security and Protection\n\n**1. Security Best Practices:**\n   - **Caution with Links and Attachments:** Avoid clicking on links or opening attachments from unsolicited emails. Hover over links to check the URL before clicking.\n   - **Strong Passwords and MFA:** Use complex passwords and enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for added security.\n   - **Regular Updates:** Keep software and devices updated with the latest security patches.\n   - **Antivirus and Backups:** Install reputable antivirus software and regularly back up critical data.\n\n**2. Data Protection:**\n   - **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data when sending via email or storing online.\n   - **Access Control:** Restrict data access to those who need it, using the principle of least privilege.\n   - **Layered Security:** Use Inbox Detection and Response (IDR) alongside Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) for enhanced protection.\n\n**3. Safe Usage Guidelines:**\n   - **Skepticism:** Be wary of unsolicited emails, especially those creating urgency or using spoofed domains.\n   - **Spoofing Detection:** Look for cousin domains or slight misspellings. Check sender email addresses carefully.\n   - **Avoid Rushing:** Take time to verify information, even if an email seems urgent.\n\n**4. Common Risks and Prevention:**\n   - **Phishing Awareness:** Educate yourself on phishing tactics, including BEC and email spoofing.\n   - **Monitoring:** Regularly check accounts for suspicious activity.\n   - **Public Wi-Fi Caution:** Avoid accessing sensitive info on public Wi-Fi without a VPN.\n\n**5. Privacy Protection:**\n   - **Personal Info Handling:** Be cautious with sharing personal details online.\n   - **Privacy Settings:** Use privacy settings on social media and disable location sharing when unnecessary.\n   - **Device Security:** Use passwords or biometric locks for devices.\n\n**6. Seeking Support:**\n   - **Report Incidents:** Immediately report suspicious emails or security incidents to IT.\n   - **Stay Informed:** Regularly update your knowledge on security threats and defenses.\n   - **Additional Tools:** Consider encrypted communication channels for sensitive discussions.\n\nBy following these guidelines, users can significantly enhance their security posture and protect against evolving threats.",
