      "user_guidance": "### Security Guidance for End-Users\n\nHere are practical, easy-to-follow security recommendations to help protect your data and maintain a secure environment:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Easy-to-Follow Security Best Practices**\n\n- **Use Strong Passwords**:  \n  - Create unique, complex passwords for all accounts (e.g., mix of letters, numbers, and symbols).  \n  - Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts.  \n  - Enable a password manager to securely store and generate strong passwords.  \n\n- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:  \n  - Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., SMS code, authenticator app, or biometric) when logging in.  \n\n- **Keep Software Updated**:  \n  - Regularly update your operating system, applications, and security software to protect against vulnerabilities.  \n\n- **Be Cautious with Downloads**:  \n  - Only download files and software from trusted sources. Read user reviews and check the publisher\u2019s credentials.  \n\n- **Use Antivirus/Anti-Malware Tools**:  \n  - Install reputable antivirus software and schedule regular scans to detect and remove threats.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n\n- **Backup Your Data**:  \n  - Regularly back up important files to an external drive or cloud storage service (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive).  \n  - Use the **3-2-1 backup rule**: 3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite location.  \n\n- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**:  \n  - Use encryption for sensitive files, emails, or removable storage devices to prevent unauthorized access.  \n  - Enable full-disk encryption (e.g., BitLocker for Windows, FileVault for macOS) on your devices.  \n\n- **Securely Share Files**:  \n  - Use encrypted channels (e.g., encrypted email or secure file-sharing services) when sharing sensitive data.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n\n- **Spot Phishing Attempts**:  \n  - Be suspicious of unsolicited emails, links, or attachments. Verify the sender\u2019s identity before clicking or opening.  \n  - Look for red flags like spelling mistakes, urgent tone, or generic greetings.  \n\n- **Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Activities**:  \n  - Refrain from accessing sensitive accounts or entering personal information when using public Wi-Fi.  \n  - Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to encrypt your connection if you must use public Wi-Fi.  \n\n- **Log Out of Accounts**:  \n  - Always log out of accounts, especially on public or shared devices.  \n\n- **Monitor Device Privacy**:  \n  - Disable unnecessary permissions (e.g., location tracking, microphone access) for apps.  \n  - Regularly review app permissions on your devices.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n\n- **Phishing Attacks**:  \n  - Scammers may impersonate trusted organizations to steal credentials.  \n  - **Prevention**: Verify the source before responding to emails, and never provide sensitive information via email.  \n\n- **Malware**:  \n  - Malicious software can harm your device or steal data.  \n  - **Prevention**: Avoid suspicious downloads and use antivirus software.  \n\n- **Weak Wi-Fi Security**:  \n  - Unsecured networks can expose your data to interception.  \n  - **Prevention**: Use strong Wi-Fi passwords and enable WPA3 encryption.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n\n- **Minimize Data Sharing**:  \n  - Only share personal information with trusted individuals or organizations.  \n  - Be cautious about sharing sensitive data on social media.  \n\n- **Use Privacy Tools**:  \n  - Enable privacy settings on social media platforms and browsers.  \n  - Use a private search engine (e.g., DuckDuckGo) instead of tracking-based ones.  \n\n- **Enable Data Minimization**:  \n  - Provide only the necessary information when signing up for services.  \n\n- **Secure Physical Devices**:  \n  - Use screen locks or biometric authentication on devices.  \n  - Keep devices in a safe place to prevent theft.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n\n- If you suspect a breach or infection, contact your organization\u2019s IT department or a cybersecurity professional immediately.  \n- Seek help if you:  \n  - Receive suspicious emails or messages.  \n  - Notice unusual account activity.  \n  - Encounter ransomware or malware.  \n  - Need assistance with data recovery or encryption.  \n\n---\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches and protect your personal and professional data.
