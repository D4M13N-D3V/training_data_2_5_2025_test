Download Privacy Features INclude Do Not Sell my Private Information Capability Enable DSAR On One Page Generate LGPD-Compatible Privacy Policy Templates Installation Wizard for Quick Start Option To Delete or Anonymize Data Automatically Or Manually Track, Manage and Withdraw Consent FAQ Can the LGPD Framework manage a users cookie preferences? No. In our current version the popup only records that a user accepts that they know the site uses cookies. The cookie descriptions should be listed in the privacy policy page. How is this plugin difference from the privacy tools in WordPress? The privacy tools in WordPress only allow you to manually handle requests. Our plugin can automate the process. Additionally, the plugin also allows for custom consent types. Can I create custom consents for different parts of my website? Yes! Any number of consent checkboxes can be created and tracked for use with forms, newsletter sign-ups, surveys and more. Can I change the look and feel of the cookie acceptance popup? Yes. The plugin allows for some customization. What is the difference between delete and anonymize my data? Delete will fully remove a user from the database. Anonymize will remove any private information for field setup to be anonymous. Information is removed, but some information in the database remains. Can users download a copy of their private information? Yes. Users can download an HTML or JSON copy of their private information stored on the website. Will the LGDP Framework automatically generate a privacy page for me? Yes. The plugin will generate a privacy policy page. To complete the page, a web administrator must complete any policy information unique to the business. These are marked with To-Do. Does the plugin accept requests to not sell a users private information? Yes. A shortcode is available to add a form so users can opt out. A record of submissions is available as a custom post type in the administration area of WordPress. Does the LGDP Framework offer free support? Yes. Support requests can be submitted through the Data443 support page and a specialist will help you with your issue. Can the plugin scan other servers and devices for a users private information? Yes, but this feature is not available in the free version of the plugin. Data443s Data Identification Manager solution has the ability to connect to services like Office 365, Sharepoint, Salesforce and more. Can I show my user that I am compliant with current privacy regulations? Yes. The plugin offers a free seal available for businesses to place on their site.

    "content": "**WordPress Security and Privacy Guide Using LGPD Framework**\n\n1. **Enable LGPD Framework Features:**\n   - **Do Not Sell My Data:** Create a shortcode and place it on a visible page, such as the footer or a dedicated privacy page.\n   - **Cookie Preferences:** Since the plugin only records acceptance, explicitly list cookies in your privacy policy for transparency.\n\n2. **Manage Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR):**\n   - Use the plugin's automation to handle DSAR efficiently. Provide a form on your site for users to submit requests and clearly communicate how to do so.\n\n3. **Customize Privacy Policy:**\n   - The plugin generates a privacy policy. Customize it by filling in sections marked with \"To-Do\" to include business-specific information.\n\n4. **Implement Consent Management:**\n   - Create custom consent checkboxes for forms, newsletters, and surveys to meet specific needs.\n   - Ensure users can easily withdraw consent, providing clear instructions on how to do so.\n\n5. **Data Handling Practices:**\n   - Regularly delete or anonymize data. Consider automating this process if the plugin allows.\n   - Train your team on proper data handling to prevent misuse.\n\n6. **Safe Usage Guidelines:**\n   - **Updates:** Regularly check for updates for the plugin, WordPress, themes, and plugins. Enable auto-updates where possible.\n   - **Backups:** Use a reputable backup plugin or service to protect data.\n   - **Encryption:** Use HTTPS for all data transmission to ensure security.\n\n7. **Mitigate Common Risks:**\n   - **Third-Party Plugins:** Only install reputable plugins and keep them updated.\n   - **Phishing:** Train your team to recognize phishing attempts to safeguard credentials.\n   - **Data Breaches:** Develop an incident response plan and test it regularly.\n\n8. **Enhance Privacy Protection:**\n   - **Compliance Seal:** Display the plugin's compliance seal on your site to assure users of your commitment to privacy.\n   - **Transparency:** Clearly explain data usage in simple terms, avoiding legal jargon.\n\n9. **Seek Additional Support When Needed:**\n   - **Large Data Handling:** Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) if your site manages extensive personal data.\n   - **Data Breach:** Engage security experts immediately if a breach is suspected.\n   - **Complex Requirements:** Contact support or professionals for tailored solutions beyond the plugin's capabilities.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively secure your WordPress site with the LGPD Framework, ensuring compliance and user trust.",
