Data443 or the Company  OTCPK ATDS , a leading data security and privacy software company, today announced that a 1-for-2,000 Reverse Stock Split of its outstanding common stock has become effective and has commenced trading today on a split-adjusted basis. Per the requirements of FINRA, Data443s stock symbol will temporarily change to ATDSD and revert back to ATDS after 20 business days. The new CUSIP Number for the Companys common stock will be 23804G203. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, 2,000 pre-split shares of common stock outstanding will automatically combine into one new share of common stock without any action on the part of the holders. The number of outstanding shares of common stock will be reduced from approximately 1,483,888,965 to approximately 741,945. Jason Remillard, Data443s founder and Chief Executive Officer, commented, By effecting the Reverse Stock Split and applying to a national stock exchange, we are executing our plan of growing the Company and making our stock more attractive for our shareholders and investors. The timing is right to take these steps and complete our transformation, positioning the Company for long-term success. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares because they hold a number of pre-Reverse Stock Split shares of the Companys common stock not evenly divisible by 2,000 will have the number of post-Reverse Stock Split shares of the Companys common stock to which they are entitled rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares of the Companys common stock.

Avoid reusing passwords across different accounts.\n- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification for account access.\n- **Regular Software Updates**: Keep all software, operating systems, and apps updated to protect against vulnerabilities.\n- **Be Cautious with Emails**: Avoid opening links or attachments from unknown sources to prevent phishing attacks.\n\n#### 2. Data Protection Recommendations\n- **Backup Data Regularly**: Use reliable backup solutions, both physical and cloud-based, to protect against data loss.\n- **Use Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit to ensure confidentiality.\n- **Secure Data Storage**: Store backup media securely, offsite if possible, to safeguard against physical threats.\n\n#### 3. Safe Usage Guidelines\n- **Safe Browsing**: Avoid suspicious websites and ensure connections are secure (look for \"https\" in URLs).\n- **Public Wi-Fi Caution**: Use a VPN when accessing sensitive data on public networks to encrypt data in transit.\n- **Software Downloads**: Only download from trusted sources to minimize malware risks.\n\n#### 4. Common Security Risks and Prevention\n- **Malware Threats**: Install reputable antivirus software and scan regularly to detect and remove threats.\n- **Phishing Attempts**: Educate yourself to recognize phishing emails and report them without responding.\n- **Physical Security**: Protect devices from theft and unauthorized access with locks and secure storage.\n\n#### 5. Privacy Protection Measures\n- **Data Minimization**: Collect and retain only necessary data to reduce exposure in case of breaches.\n- **Use Privacy Tools**: Consider using VPNs and privacy-focused browsers to enhance online anonymity.\n- **Review Policies**: Familiarize yourself with company privacy policies and adjust settings to limit data sharing.\n\n#### 6. When to Seek Additional Security Support\n- **Incident Occurrence**: Contact IT or security experts immediately if you suspect a breach or data loss.\n- **Complex Threats**: Seek professional help when dealing with sophisticated threats like ransomware or targeted attacks.\n- **Compliance Needs**: Consult with experts to ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR or CCPA, especially if handling sensitive data.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly enhance your data security and privacy.
