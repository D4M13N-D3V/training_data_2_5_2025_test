Management Commentary Jason Remillard, Data443s founder and Chief Executive Officer, commented, We continue to see the pandemic recovery resulting in new business activity for the Company. Many large-scale projects on hold from the early stages of the pandemic have been brought back to the table for execution with new urgency. Indeed, in many cases, the urgency has grown, and clients demand faster delivery of solutions. Building upon our solid 2020 results, 2021 continues to demonstrate our capabilities and the success of our business plan. Although the world is still very much in a pandemic situation, we continue to retain our customers, deliver value, and grow in key segments. Additionally, we executed key debt management actions to simplify our balance sheet and prepare for more effective and efficient financing vehicles. The launch of our streamlined marketing initiatives in 2021 is the foundation with which we will capture new clients, with upgraded messaging and a combined privacy-first storyline that ties in our current and planned acquisitions. Data443 will execute these programs throughout the year. They will be a combination of virtual and hybrid-virtual as the year progresses, and various portions of the world respond to pandemic restrictions easing. Either way, we plan a balanced and effective sales and marketing plan that adjusts to current environments that are appropriate for each region for maximum effectiveness. Our new product enhancements and services continue to be industry-leading, and our most recent Ransomware Recovery Manager  is no exception. Providing clients not only a ransomware protection system, but a full device recovery platform is unique to the industry and places Data443 again at the forefront of senior IT leaders minds as providing capabilities that have immediate value and business need. Remillard concluded by stating, The first Quarter of 2021 has delivered as expected. Many projects are being taken back off the shelf, and a new sense of urgency surrounding data privacy with continued breaches, ransomware, and data loss occurring worldwide. Our hundreds of enterprise customers include leading brand names in a diverse set of industries, such as financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, technology, and telecommunications. The rest of 2021 will see further enhancements to our product offerings and a robust go-to-market strategy fueled by new technology alliances within the IT infrastructure and security vendor ecosystem. We feel we are well-positioned to continue to benefit from these market conditions that we have prepared for over a long time. Once again, we thank all of our key stakeholders, including our loyal stockholders, for their continued support.
