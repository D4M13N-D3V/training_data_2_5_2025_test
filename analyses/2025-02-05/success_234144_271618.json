At the core of this new release is functionality that we are calling contextual access control . We believe that to securely share data and connect organizations we need to go beyond todays narrow definition of identity to a broader understanding, one that is focused on context. Organizations today are in a tricky spot. They fully acknowledge that the world has become digital, and that to be competitive they must connect and collaborate with outside parties. On the other hand, sharing resources with partners and customers is inherently risky. Many still feel that the security concerns outweigh the benefits. Others use Identity and Access Management IAM systems that were built for internal sharing, and use identity, provisioned by a single entity as the root of trust. Going beyond identity to focus on context however, allows us to reimagine IAM for the connected world. Contextual access control offers a way for organizations to gather enough context to form a more complete picture of these external parties. Fundamentally, the more you know about the context of an access request the more likely you are to make the correct access decision. Contextual access is about connecting to data sources so that we can answer sophisticated questions before granting access. These questions fall into the following categories Subject  What are the details about the person requesting access? Role, group memberships, department, company, certifications, biometrics etc. Action  What is the person attempting to do? Read, write, edit, download etc. Resource  What resource will be impacted by the action? Apps, docs, APIs, services etc. Environment  What is the environment of the request? Time, location, device type etc. Broadening the definition of what we mean by identity allows us to ask and answer questions like Is this a doctor? or Is this a trusted device? Interestingly we are seeing a number of industry experts who are also talking about context in the same breath as identity. For example, in a recent article Forresters VP and Principal Analyst, Andras Cser,  acser  defined identity as follows By identity, we mean a specific set of attributes that, when paired with the right context, and policy evaluation engine, allows the user to connect and access only the company data and apps that they are supposed to have access to.

    "content": "Resilient Access 3.0 offers a comprehensive security solution by enhancing traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems with contextual access control. This approach considers four key categories\u2014Subject, Action, Resource, and Environment\u2014to make more informed access decisions, thereby improving security without being overly restrictive. Here's a structured overview of the solution:\n\n### Key Features and Benefits:\n1. **Contextual Awareness**: The system evaluates access requests based on detailed context, enhancing security by considering the user's role, the resource being accessed, the environment, and the specific action requested.\n\n2. **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Allows precise permission setting, reducing the risk of over-privilege and potential breaches.\n\n3. **Policy Evaluation Engine**: Acts as the core to process contextual data and enforce policies effectively.\n\n4. **Data Protection**: Utilizes encryption to safeguard data, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.\n\n5. **Scalability and Performance**: Designed to handle growing demands without becoming a performance bottleneck.\n\n### Integration and Compliance:\n- **Integration with Existing Systems**: API-based architecture and connectors for SAML and OAuth2 facilitate seamless integration with current IAM solutions.\n- **Compliance**: Aligned with standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA, though specific certifications would provide additional assurance.\n\n### User Best Practices:\n- **Strong Authentication**: Emphasizes multi-factor authentication to add an extra security layer.\n- **Phishing Awareness Training**: Crucial to prevent social engineering attacks.\n- **Regular Policy Reviews**: Ensures access permissions remain current and appropriate.\n\n### Technical Considerations:\n- **Deployment Flexibility**: Supports on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments.\n- **Compatibility**: Works across various operating systems and browsers, ensuring broad accessibility.\n\n### Considerations:\n- **Potential Latency**: Context evaluation might introduce delays, impacting user experience.\n- **Complexity Management**: Requires investment in policy setup and management to avoid issues.\n- **Privacy Concerns**: Handling of detailed user data necessitates secure management and compliance with privacy regulations.\n\nResilient Access 3.0 presents a robust security solution, offering enhanced protection through contextual insights. Organizations considering this solution should weigh its benefits against potential complexity and privacy challenges, ensuring careful management to maximize its effectiveness.",
