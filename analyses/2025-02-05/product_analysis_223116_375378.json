July 16, 2020 Companies worldwide are up against sophisticated email attacks like Business Email Compromises BEC . These attacks are also known as spear phishing, impersonation, and whaling, with the goal of convincing an end-user to release money or provide account information. Related Microsoft 365 Is Wildly Successful and Profoundly Vulnerable  Heres Why One method of phishing is known as a Phishing URL. In this attack, you receive an email from Microsoft asking you to verify your credentials. The email looks completely normal, but what lurks behind the verify button isnt. The goal here is to steal your account password or other confidential information by tricking you into believing youre on a legitimate website. Its effective, and even tricked savvy tech reporters on this classic Reply All episode What Kind Of Idiot Gets Phished? If youre already using an email gateway and URL wrapping, good for you! But youre only halfway there. When an email hits your email gateway, its scanned and then delivered to your inbox. The gateway checked the emails links against a database and the results came back clean. We can relax, right? What your SEG doesnt see? The verify your credentials email from Microsoft actually links to a cooking website. Since that site is real, the email sailed through. Then 5 minutes later, the clever attackers redirect the URL from the cooking site to a known Microsoft phishing site. We call this method a delayed detonation. Time to layer Inbox Detection and Response on top of SEGs Inbox Security is a new technology that puts inbox detection and response right inside the mailbox.
