This particular phishing scheme used COVID-19-related lures to defraud Microsoft 365 customers. Its one of many attacks weve seen. With tensions high and IT resources stretched to the limit, the pandemic is the perfect storm for cloud inbox security. Related Microsoft 365 Is Wildly Successful and Profoundly Vulnerable  Heres Why But this isnt a 2020 phenomenon The really sobering stat? Before Covid-19, 78 of Microsoft 365 administrators were already reporting security breaches, citing phishing as the leading cause. And according to the FBIs 2019 Internet Crime Report , those phishing attacks cost US businesses and local governments 1.7 billion last year. No matter the state of the pandemic, vaccinations, or a return to somewhat normal life, Microsoft will remain uniquely vulnerable to phishing Its native security has a 16 false negative rate for spam and phishing emails, according to Mimecast. If a scammer uses a spoofedlookalikesoundalike domain that doesnt exactly match your domain name, Microsoft 365 wont flag the activity. It also wont flag spoofed domains for your business partners or even well-known brands. Saleforce.com will still go through. Microsoft 365 uses static blacklists when scanning URLs for threats. Meanwhile phishing sites can have short life spans, even just a few hours. Analyzing each site in real time is a far stronger form of prevention. And Microsoft 365 has features such as Safe Attachments , which uses virtual sandboxing to scan attachments in an email. But sophisticated threats require deeper inspection of embedded documents and code. Inbox Detection and Response is our best defense Enterprises using cloud-hosted email urgently need an inner layer of email security called Inbox Detection and Response IDR. While the trusty Secure Email Gateway filters spam and known threats, it cant detect sophisticated or evasive attacks like spear phishing and cousin domain spoofing. IDR solutions instead hook into users inboxes, continuously scan all inbound and outbound emails in all folders, and automatically follow links. They check URLs for favicons, mismatched logos, legitimate site maps, domain owners, security certificates, even regionalized code  all indicators that help flag, Is this a valid email or is it phishing? Best of all, when threats are uncovered, IDR solutions can automatically delete every copy across every mailbox. This automatic remediation removes the burden on the email administrator or security analyst and massively reduces the feared window of vulnerability caused by malicious emails lingering for lengthy periods within the reach of users.

    "content": "### End-User Guidance on Data Security and Protection\n\n#### 1. Security Best Practices\n\n- **Be Cautious with Emails**: Especially those related to COVID-19. Avoid opening suspicious emails, even if they seem urgent or relevant.\n- **Use Strong Passwords**: Create unique, complex passwords for each account and consider using a password manager.\n- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts.\n- **Regular Updates**: Ensure your software and devices are updated to protect against vulnerabilities.\n- **Backup Data**: Regularly back up important data to an external drive or cloud storage.\n\n#### 2. Data Protection Recommendations\n\n- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use encryption for highly sensitive information to protect it from unauthorized access.\n- **Secure File Sharing**: Use secure methods to share files, such as encrypted email or secure file-sharing services.\n- **Periodic Backups**: Schedule regular backups to prevent data loss in case of an attack or system failure.\n\n#### 3. Safe Usage Guidelines\n\n- **Verify Senders**: Check the sender's email address and look for red flags like typos or unusual domains.\n- **Avoid Suspicious Links and Attachments**: Hover over links to see the URL and avoid opening unexpected attachments.\n- **Use Secure Networks**: Avoid accessing sensitive data on public Wi-Fi without a VPN.\n\n#### 4. Common Security Risks and Prevention\n\n- **Phishing Attacks**: Be vigilant of emails impersonating trusted sources, especially those using COVID-19 themes. Verify the legitimacy of requests.\n- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: Watch for emails that appear to be from executives or suppliers requesting urgent actions or payments.\n- **Domain Spoofing**: Be cautious of emails from domains that resemble legitimate ones. Look for slight variations in spelling.\n\n#### 5. Privacy Protection Measures\n\n- **Limit Data Sharing**: Only share personal or sensitive information with trusted parties.\n- **Enable Privacy Settings**: Customize privacy settings on social media and other platforms to limit exposure.\n- **Monitor Accounts**: Regularly check for unauthorized access or unusual activity in your accounts.\n\n#### 6. When to Seek Additional Security Support\n\n- **Security Incidents**: If you suspect a breach or phishing attack, report it immediately to your IT department.\n- **Expert Consultation**: Engage with security professionals for advanced threats, suspicious activity, or post-incident response.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nConsider implementing advanced solutions like Inbox Detection and Response (IDR) to enhance security beyond native Microsoft 365 features. Tools like Cyren Inbox Security offer automated threat detection and remediation, reducing vulnerabilities. Stay informed and proactive to protect against evolving cyber threats.",
