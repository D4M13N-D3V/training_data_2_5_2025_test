      "user_guidance": "### Security Best Practices Based on Data Classification\n\n#### 1. Security Best Practices\n- **Categorize Data**: Classify data into levels such as public, internal, and confidential to prioritize protection.\n- **Implement Access Control**: Use role-based access to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.\n- **Conduct Regular Audits**: Periodically review data classifications to ensure accuracy and relevance.\n- **Train Employees**: Educate staff on the importance of data classification and handling procedures.\n\n#### 2. Data Protection Recommendations\n- **Encrypt Data**: Use AES-256 for data at rest and TLS for data in transit.\n- **Backup and Recovery**: Develop robust backup plans to prevent data loss.\n- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enhance security with MFA beyond password protection.\n- **Keep Software Updated**: Regularly update systems to protect against vulnerabilities.\n\n#### 3. Safe Usage Guidelines\n- **UseApproved Channels**: Share data via secure platforms, avoiding personal accounts.\n- **Avoid Phishing Scams**: Verify email senders and refrain from opening suspicious attachments.\n- **Clean Desk Policy**: Secure sensitive data when not in use and shred documents properly.\n\n#### 4. Common Security Risks and Prevention\n- **Insider Threats**: Monitor access and use controls to mitigate risks.\n- **Data Breaches**: Employ encryption and secure sharing practices.\n- **Phishing Risks**: Educate users and implement email filtering.\n- **Physical Theft**: Use security measures like locks and clean desks.\n- **Third-Party Risks**: Vet vendors and include security clauses in contracts.\n\n#### 5. Privacy Protection Measures\n- **Compliance with Regulations**: Adhere to GDPR, CCPA, etc., for legal compliance.\n- **Data Anonymization**: Use techniques like pseudonymization to protect identities.\n- **Review Policies Regularly**: Update policies to ensure effectiveness.\n- **User Consent**: Inform users about data usage and respect their preferences.\n\n#### 6. When to Seek Additional Support\n- **Data Breach Incidents**: Engage experts to handle and investigate breaches.\n- **Specialized Data Handling**: Consult specialists if in-house expertise is lacking.\n- **Future Planning**: Involve experts in scalable security strategy development.\n- **Compliance Challenges**: Seek legal advice for complex regulatory issues.\n- **Unusual Activity**: Conduct security audits to address potential threats.\n\nThese guidelines provide a comprehensive approach to enhancing data security, ensuring organizations can protect their assets effectively."
