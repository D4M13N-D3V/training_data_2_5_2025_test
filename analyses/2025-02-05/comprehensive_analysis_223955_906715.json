Malware Targeting Amazon Shoppers December 24, 2018 Shopping for Christmas gifts has never been easier, especially with Amazonand who doesnt use Amazon ? This is why using fake Amazon orders is a favorite method bad actors have been using this time of year to bait rushed Christmas shoppers. As a warning to anybody everybody? caught up in receiving last-minute Amazon deliveries, weve come across a malicious email campaign see image below to install a variant of the Emotet malware, a polymorphic banking Trojan that is virtual machine-aware and primarily functions as a downloader or dropper of other malware such as spyware and ransomware. The gift that keeps on giving Since its a Trojan, that means the malicious campaign could have one of many objectives or multiple objectives!once a user has installed it, what happens next depends on what module the cybercriminal decides to deploy, although its usually a module intended to steal passwords or to steal emails. Figure 1 Fake email pretending to be an Amazon order confirmation The above email, which appears to be an order confirmation from Amazon, is anything butit is part of a large malware campaign which is proving very active during this Christmas 2018 holiday season. If the recipient is puzzled by the suggestion of an Amazon order they dont believe they made which they didnt and clicks on the order details button, a file named ORDER_DETAILS_FORM.doc is downloaded that contains a malicious macro, and the user is asked to enable the content. Figure 2 User is asked to enable content to view online Word doc Under the hood Garbage code and obfuscation used Checking the contents of the macro code, at first glance it appears to be obfuscated. But careful inspection reveals that most of it is just garbage code. The important part is the interaction where the Shell method executes a command line. Figure 3 Shell method executed command line The shell command content is also a bit obfuscated, including a directory traversal at the start of the command and uses PROGRaMDatA0,1prOGrAMdatA9,2 which is equal to CmD Figure 3 PowerShell script variable shown in red box The value of 2khP shown in the red box in figure 3 is a PowerShell script which is reversed. The image of the code shown below was organized for readability. Here we can see that the PowerShell string is also obfuscated by using powPUBLIC5,1rSESSIONNAME-4,1hTEMP-3,1ll. The script will try and download the EXE payload on one of the following sites hxxppatrickhouston.comyGW2p6bq hxxpparii.compiwiktmp4KfmNmAnm1 hxxppsyberhawk.comkDjKJgkew1 hxxppanjabi.net79yH0YT hxxppcmindustries.comFsABdpKjM Figure 4 Destination download sites shown Emotet Config RSA key MGgCYQC85lbnScQ4lPukQ3PWwsNtZzOqJQJRNdoNsTQx8cd86j1WDK8ZfcuvW0TUmvm3U13lLQ7ZsyGl1dppBePSSl8PvdaIbbCxsJ8mp7Q1IiwRuojhHT4yJap28CAwEAAQ CnC 103.9.226.57443 109.104.79.488080 115.160.160.13480 130.241.16.15480 133.242.208.1838080 138.68.139.199443 144.76.117.2478080 159.65.76.245443 165.227.213.1738080 179.60.24.16450000 181.168.130.2198090 181.197.253.1338080 185.86.148.2228080 187.137.178.62443 187.140.90.918080 190.13.222.1208080 190.147.19.32443 190.73.133.668080 192.155.90.907080 198.199.185.25443 198.61.196.188080 201.190.150.60443 210.2.86.728080 213.120.119.2318443 219.94.254.938080 23.254.203.518080 49.212.135.76443 5.9.128.1638080 60.48.92.22980 69.198.17.208080 70.28.2.1718080 70.55.69.2027080 78.189.21.13180 81.150.17.15850000 81.150.17.1588443 86.43.100.19443 92.48.118.278080 Indicators of Compromise and Cyren Detection SHA256 Object Type Remarks Detection 5748091ed2f71992fac8eda3ca86212d942adfad28cfd7c1574c5f56b4d124d4 Email Your Amazon.com order.eml HTMLDownldr.BE d17017dd6b262beede4a9e3ec41877ee1efcd27f7dff1a50fc1e7de2d45c1783 DOC ORDER_DETAILS_FORM.doc W97MAgent.gen 40583fafdb858bef8aace8ae91febbbc98eded8c0590e01fb4fafe269fdf002c W32 EXE compareiface.exe W32Emotet.LD.gen!Eldorado Try it for Free Instant Data Classification Cyren URL Category Chacker Prev Office 365 Top Brand Targeted by Phishing Kits in 2018 Was Sie tun k\u00f6nnen, um Office 365-E-Mail-Benutzer vor Phishing zu sch\u00fctzen Next Company Partners Resources Investor Relations Products Freeware Demo Solutions Contact Us Privacy Management Service by Data443",

  "analysis": "**Comprehensive Analysis of Security Alert: Emotet Malware Targeting Amazon Shoppers**\n\n**1. Security Features and Their Benefits to Users**\n\n- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** The alert provides specific IoCs such as SHA256 hashes and file types, enabling users to identify and block the malware effectively. This early detection helps prevent widespread infection and protects sensitive data.\n\n- **Detection and Mitigation:** The mention of tools detecting Emotet as HTMLDownldr.BE and W32Emotet.LD.gen!Eldorado allows users to configure their security systems to recognize and quarantine threats, reducing the risk of compromise.\n\n- **URL Categorization:** By categorizing malicious URLs, security solutions can block access to these sites, preventing download of the EXE payload and thus safeguarding against infection.\n\n**2. Compliance Certifications and Regulatory Adherence**\n\nThe content does not specify compliance certifications, but relevant standards for data security include:\n\n- **GDPR Compliance:** Ensures data protection and privacy, granting users control over their personal information and the right to consent.\n\n- **ISO 27001:** Demonstrates adherence to stringent information security management, building user trust in data handling practices.\n\n- **Anti-Phishing Certifications:** Enhances email security, a critical area given the phishing nature of the attack, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of communications.\n\n**3. User-Focused Security Recommendations**\n\n- **Caution with Emails:** Users should verify sender identities, especially during busy periods like Christmas, to avoid succumbing to phishing attempts.\n\n- **Avoiding Macro Enablement:** Disabling macros in documents from unknown sources can prevent automatic malware execution.\n\n- **Antivirus Usage:** Regularly updated antivirus software is crucial for detecting and removing threats like Emotet.\n\n- **User Education:** Training employees to recognize phishing emails reduces the human vulnerability factor in security.\n\n**4. Technical Security Implementation Details**\n\n- **Network Monitoring:** Implementing traffic monitoring and intrusion detection systems can identify and block suspicious activities characteristic of Emotet.\n\n- **Mail Server Configuration:** Enhancing email security with DMARC, SPF, and DKIM protocols reduces phishing risks.\n\n- **Endpoint Protection:** Solutions like EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) offer real-time threat detection and response, mitigating malware impacts.\n\n**5. Data Protection Measures**\n\n- **Encryption:** Encrypting sensitive data ensures it remains unreadable to attackers, even if compromised.\n\n- **Access Controls:** Restricting data access to necessary personnel limits potential damage from breaches.\n\n- **Regular Backups:** Maintaining backups allows quick recovery without ransom payment, safeguarding against ransomware.\n\n**6. Best Practices for End Users**\n\n- **Software Updates:** Regularly updating systems and applications patches vulnerabilities exploited by malware.\n\n- **Strong Passwords:** Using unique, complex passwords, ideally with a password manager, reduces risk of credential theft.\n\n- **Security Tools:** Employing firewalls, antivirus, and email filters adds layers of defense against attacks.\n\n- **Phishing Vigilance:**-hovering over links, checking for typos, and verifying sources before clicking can prevent falling victim to phishing.\n\nBy following these measures, users enhance their security posture, protecting against threats like Emotet and ensuring a safer digital environment."
