Today, they have taken center stage and are now considered vital to the real-time collaboration goals of the connected economy. Gartner predicts that by 2020, 80 of large and midsize organizations will have deployed at least one of these platforms as part of their content collaboration strategy. Gartner also recently renamed the category from Enterprise File Sync and Share EFSS to Content Collaboration Platforms to reflect its growing importance. Not surprisingly as these platforms have become more strategic they have also come under greater scrutiny regarding their security. For the most part they have made great strides with increased security controls for collaboration amongst their managed or internal users, but very real security challenges remain for collaboration with non-managed or external users. Sadly, data breaches are keeping pace with the torrent of data being put on to the cloud and the trend is not likely to change. The flavor of breaches that this blog series will focus on are not traditional hacks, but serious data leakage that stems from platform vulnerabilities, lax security procedures, misconfiguration or just ignorance remember Anthony Weiners use of Twitter for what he thought were private messages?. The blame is shared between vendors and users because both sides make mistakes so the advice will target reducing vulnerabilities from any source to keep your data secure. For example, in 2017 security researchers discovered that collaboration invitations to sensitive files from companies like Dell and Ford could be found on search engines. The issue was quickly corrected but it is likely that we will see more and more of these stories in the future. For many enterprises what happens to their files once they leave the walled garden of their cloud provider remains a troubling blindspot. Resolving this vulnerability will always be a challenge since enterprises will never have the same level of control over external users as they do over their own managed users. With that said there are steps that enterprises can take to mitigate the risk involved with external collaboration. The objective of this blog series is to examine the state of security for external sharing and collaboration for the leading Content Collaboration Platforms. Each week well review a different platform and make best security practice recommendations. First up in the series will be Box so stay tuned.

    "content": "### Security Guidance for External Sharing on Content Collaboration Platforms (CCPs)\n\n#### 1. **Security Best Practices**\n   - **Access Control**:  \n     Restrict access to sensitive files by using role-based permissions. Only grant access to those who genuinely need it. Use time-limited access links or require users to log in to view shared content.\n   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:  \n     Enable MFA for all users, especially for external collaborators, to add an extra layer of security.\n   - **Encryption**:  \n     Ensure that data is encrypted both at rest and in transit. Use platforms that offer end-to-end encryption or consider encrypting files before sharing them.\n   - **Regular Audits**:  \n     Periodically review shared files, links, and user permissions to identify and revoke unnecessary access.\n\n#### 2. **Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Classify Sensitive Data**:  \n     Before sharing, classify data based on sensitivity (e.g., public, internal, confidential). Apply stricter controls to sensitive data.\n   - **Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Tools**:  \n     Implement DLP tools to monitor and prevent unauthorized sharing of sensitive data.\n   - **Watermarking**:  \n     Add watermarks to sensitive documents to deter unauthorized use or distribution.\n   - **Backup and Recovery**:  \n     Regularly back up critical data to ensure quick recovery in case of accidental deletion or a breach.\n\n#### 3. **Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Avoid Over-Sharing**:  \n     Don\u2019t share more data than necessary. Use granular permissions to control what external users can do (e.g., view-only vs. edit).\n   - **Use Secure Collaboration Tools**:  \n     Stick to approved CCPs with strong security features. Avoid using unauthorized or personal cloud storage accounts for company data.\n   - **Beware of Public Links**:  \n     Avoid creating publicly accessible links for sensitive data. If you must use them, set an expiration date or require authentication.\n   - **Educate External Users**:  \n     Remind external collaborators to use strong passwords, enable MFA, and avoid sharing links or files with unauthorized parties.\n\n#### 4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Data Leakage**:  \n     Risk: Sensitive files shared externally can be leaked due to misconfigured permissions or over-sharing.  \n     Prevention: Use audits, DLP tools, and restrict permissions to mitigate this risk.\n   - **Phishing Attacks**:  \n     Risk: Attackers may impersonate external collaborators to trick users into sharing data or credentials.  \n     Prevention: Train users to spot phishing attempts and verify requests through separate communication channels.\n   - **Misconfigured Settings**:  \n     Risk: Incorrect settings can expose data to unauthorized users or search engines.  \n     Prevention: Regularly review platform settings and follow vendor security guidelines.\n\n#### 5. **Privacy Protection Measures**\n   - **Compliance with Regulations**:  \n     Ensure that sharing practices comply with data protection laws like GDPR, CCPA, or HIPAA, depending on your industry.\n   - **Minimize PII Exposure**:  \n     Avoid sharing personally identifiable information (PII) unless absolutely necessary. Use anonymization or redaction where possible.\n   - **Respect User Privacy**:  \n     Inform collaborators about how their data will be used, stored, and shared. Obtain explicit consent when required.\n\n#### 6. **When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n   - **Complex Sharing Scenarios**:  \n     If sharing sensitive data with multiple external parties, consult your IT or security team to ensure proper controls are in place.\n   - **Custom Security Needs**:  \n     If your organization has specific compliance or regulatory requirements, seek expertise to implement tailored security measures.\n   - **Incident Response**:  \n     If you suspect a data breach or unauthorized access, contact your security team immediately to investigate and mitigate the issue.\n\n#### Final Tips:\n   - **Stay Informed**:  \n     Keep up with updates and security patches for your CCP.  \n   - **Monitor Activity**:  \n     Regularly monitor logs for unusual activity, such as multiple failed login attempts or unexpected file downloads.  \n   - **User Training**:  \n     Provide ongoing training for users to ensure they understand the risks and best practices for external collaboration.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with sharing data on CCPs and ensure a safer collaboration experience for all users.",
