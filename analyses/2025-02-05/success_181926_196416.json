December 21, 2019 Businesses need to map personal information now to have full control and insight into all customer data, or Personal Information PI as defined by the CCPA . How Do I Map Personal Information in My Business for CCPA? To comply with the CCPAs definition of Personal Information , businesses must build a full map of all customer data. Any information that can be used to draw inferences about a customer is covered by the law. So businesses are responsible for drastically broadening their view and control of consumer data. The first solution to this challenge that comes to mind is building a data inventory. Normally, data inventories are built by simply throwing together all conduits of data within your organization.

As the law intends, organizations must now be in full control of their data from top to bottom. This data must be constantly up to date, accurate, and fully accessible. Many companies are still mapping their data with surveys. And the true extent of this mishandling of data will become evident when CCPA is introduced  just like it did with GDPR. Compliancy does not have to cause anxiety and worry to business owners inoperating-in California. This law is being introduced to move the power of data back into the hands of the customer. Thus, creating room for significant space to develop between competitors in the realm of customer trust and relationships.
