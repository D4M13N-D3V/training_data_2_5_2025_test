Data443 or the Company OTCPK ATDS D , OTCPK ATDS , the leading data security and privacy software company for ALL THINGS DATA SECURITY  , today announced operating results for the year ended December 31, 2021.

We have moved quickly to ramp our capabilities to meet the growing demand for enterprise protection of data across cloud, hybrid cloud, and on-premises. Historically, through the adoption of regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, we have always taken an approach of building out our capabilities to meet the evolving landscape of data privacy and security. Then last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a rule that would impose mandatory reporting for companies around data breaches and other significant cybersecurity incidents within four days. As a Company, we have always understood that data security and privacy legislation would continue driving significant investment by organizations to offset risks from data breaches and damaging information disclosures. In 2021, we continued to manage the business closely. We worked hard to reduce our loss on derivative liabilities by nearly 7 million, or 92 from a year ago, when we reduced our derivative liabilities by over 10 million. At the same time, we managed to close two additional and critically important acquisitions and expanded our marketing footprint to grow awareness of the Data443 product suite. To this day, we are capitalizing on the market opportunities that were experiencing, from the pursuit of new business opportunities to the steady flow of acquisition candidates that we evaluate on a regular basis. While I am encouraged by the strong demand across our business, we will continue to invest in sales and marketing campaigns, with specific product focus on innovation and internal talent development. We look forward to continued success in 2022 as we continue to focus on revenue growth, expanding customer success, technical innovation, and delivering shareholder value. I am optimistic about our future as we pursue our up-list to a national exchange, and we execute on our plans to deliver superior technology to our customers, concluded Mr. Remillard.
