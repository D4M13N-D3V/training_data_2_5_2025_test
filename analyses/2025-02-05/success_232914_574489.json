Some years ago, local authorities in the UK were targeted by a series of just such frauds. The modus operandi of the criminals was to masquerade as legitimate suppliers of building maintenance services and contact local authority finance departments, requesting their regular payments be made to new bank accounts. The tools of the trade? Letterheads and faxes. Roll the clock forward. Now, cybercriminals are using similarly simple techniques to conduct social engineering attacks against organizations with equally successful results as the latest report from Osterman  Phishing, BEC and Ransomware Threats for Microsoft 365 Users  clearly shows. Social engineering From Business Email Compromise BEC and Email Account Compromise EAC to Account Takeover ATO attacks, experts calculate as much as 91 of all cyberattacks start with a social engineering emails Deloitte 2020. Despite best efforts, these attacks keep on getting past traditional email security defenses and into users inboxes. Managing the problem is time-consuming, costly and a waste of valuable technical expertise. So how do you stop these attacks? Protect the Inbox For over 25 years the cybersecurity industry has focused on trying to protect email users by defending the network perimeter with a Secure Email Gateway SEG but evasive social engineering attacks have always found their way past these defenses. For more information on the short-comings of perimeter email security, read our threat intelligence report,  Beyond the Email Perimeter  Now Microsoft Office 365 email is used by the majority of organizations and though the security it offers is excellent, social engineering attacks continue to evade the native security controls and arrive in the inbox. To prevent these attacks from being successful, organizations need to employ an Integrated Cloud Email Security ICES solution that works in the inbox itself, automatically detecting and remediating attacks. Stop BEC, EAC, ATO, and attacks with no payload Often, social engineering attacks have a payload  for example a phishing URL or a malware-infected attachment such as one containing ransomware. The latter tend to make the headlines when they succeed, but these attacks can be automatically detected and remediated in the inbox by the ICES if it is powered by real-time analysis and the very latest threat intelligence. But what if the attack has been carefully crafted so it doesnt contain a payload? Business Email Compromise BEC, Email Account Compromise EAC and other social engineering email attacks dont have an obvious payload. Instead, they rely on techniques of trickery and impersonation to succeed. To combat them, look for an ICES that employs the very latest Artificial Intelligence AI techniques like Machine Learning ML and Natural Language Processing NLP detect and neutralize the attacks. An ICES which uses these techniques to analyze each message as it arrives in the inbox will stop this type of social engineering attack. Cyren uses AI to stop evasive attacks Cyren Inbox Security is an ICES that protects organizations from social engineering attacks like BEC, EAC, ATO, and imposter fraud, by working inside the inbox to find and automatically remediate messages irrespective of whether they have an obvious payload. It does this using a combination of machine learning, natural language processing, and heuristics to combat the threat. In my next blog, well look at how Cyren Inbox Security uses these techniques to examine the forensic evidence in social engineering attacks and automatically remediates them from the inbox.

    "content": "**Comprehensive Analysis of Cyren Inbox Security Content**\n\n1. **Key Security Features and Benefits:**\n   - **AI-Powered Detection:** Utilizes Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect BEC attacks without payloads, enhancing protection against sophisticated threats.\n   - **Automated Remediation:** Reduces risks associated with human error by automatically remediating detected threats.\n   - **Integration with Microsoft Office 365:** Seamlessly works within widely used email systems, offering real-time threat analysis and mitigation.\n\n2. **Compliance and Regulatory Adherence:**\n   - The content lacks specific compliance certifications, such as ISO 27001 or GDPR, which are crucial for assured adherence to industry standards. Including such information would strengthen trust, especially in regulated sectors.\n\n3. **User-Focused Security Recommendations:**\n   - **Employee Education:** Regular training to identify signs of BEC, such as urgent requests or email spoofing.\n   - **Email Protocol Implementation:** Advising the use of DMARC, DKIM, and SPF to enhance email security.\n   - **Security Audits and Incident Response:** Emphasizing the importance of these measures to mitigate and respond to threats effectively.\n\n4. **Technical Implementation Details:**\n   - **Integration and Functionality:** The solution's integration with Office 365 and use of AI models for real-time analysis are strong points. However, details on AI training, data privacy, and integration with other tools are needed.\n   - **Heuristics and Metadata Analysis:** Provides an additional layer of threat detection by analyzing behavioral patterns.\n\n5. **Data Protection Measures:**\n   - **Privacy and Encryption:** The need for encryption during transmission and at rest, along with data anonymization, should be highlighted.\n   - **Data Usage Transparency:** Clarifying how incident data is used to improve AI models without compromising user confidentiality is essential.\n\n6. **Best Practices for End Users:**\n   - **Verification and Reporting:** Encourage users to verify suspicious emails and report them to IT.\n   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Recommend its use to add an extra layer of security.\n   - **Security Awareness Training:** Regular training can significantly reduce the success of BEC attacks by educating users on safe practices.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe content effectively highlights the problem of BEC attacks and presents Cyren Inbox Security as a robust solution. However, it could be enhanced by including compliance certifications, detailed data protection measures, and expanded user-focused recommendations to provide a more comprehensive overview.",
