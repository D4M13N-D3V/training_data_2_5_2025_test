The campaign coincided with 14 days of free play announced by Square Enix on July 12, 2021. During this period, we detected a total of 47,076 URLs for an average of about 1,700 per day. The attacks disappeared just as fast as they appeared. Between August 17 and September 1, we detected 1,105 Square Enix phishing URLs for an average of 70 per day. The URLs were hosted across 20,730 unique domains. Most of the phishing URLs led to fake Square Enix account login pages. et_pb_textet_pb_text _builder_version4.10.6 _module_presetdefault custom_margin35px global_colors_info secure.square-enix.com.c.dq-jp.xxxxxxx.com.araccountappsvcLogin.htm secure.square-enix.com.jjp.cn.xxxxxxx.netaccountappsvcLogin.htm secure.square-enix.com.login.zkiki.xxxxxxx.comaccountappsvcLogin.htm secure.square-enix.com.login.q-xk.xxxxxxx.com.araccountappsvcLogin.htm secure.square-enix.com.login.iius.xxxxxxx.com.araccountappsvcLogin.htm secure.square-enix.com.zcls-cey.usa.xxxxxxx.comaccountappsvclogin.html secure.square-enix.com.qacc.cn.xxxxxxx.comaccountappsvcLogin.htm Figure 1 - Square Enix phishing URLs Figure 2  Fake Square Enix login page Other URLs directed users to forum pages promoting fake game giveaways or phony petitions protesting an alleged game change by Square Enix. These forum pages then tried to obtain login credentials or redirect a user to pages designed to download Potentially Unwanted Program Adware on their device. Figure 3  Fake giveaway luring users to a phishing page These threads on Reddit and a Square Enix forum suggest this phishing campaign was also spread using the in-game chat feature, whisper. Attackers frequently use communication channels other than email to avoiddelay detection. Targeted phishing attacks often follow press releases and major events like Amazon Prime Day and national holidays. The best thing users can do is slow down and closely review emails and links before clicking calls to action, entering information, or opening attachments.

    "content": "### Comprehensive Analysis of the Security-Related Content\n\nThe provided content discusses a significant phishing campaign targeting Square Enix users, observed between July 20 and August 16, 2021, coinciding with a 14-day free play announcement. This analysis evaluates the security features, compliance certifications, user guidance, and best practices presented in the content.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Key Security Features and Their Benefits to Users**\n- **Threat Detection and Monitoring**: Cyren's ability to detect and analyze phishing URLs in real-time is highlighted. The detection of 47,076 phishing URLs during the campaign demonstrates robust monitoring capabilities.\n  - **Benefit**: Early detection of phishing campaigns helps prevent widespread compromise of user credentials.\n- **URL Categorization**: The use of tools like Cyren's URL Category Checker to classify and block malicious URLs is implied.\n  - **Benefit**: This helps organizations and users identify and avoid malicious links, reducing the risk of phishing attacks.\n- **Incident Response**: The rapid drop in phishing URLs after August 16 suggests effective takedown efforts or user awareness campaigns.\n  - **Benefit**: Quick response to threats minimizes the window of opportunity for attackers.\n- **Analytics and Reporting**: The provision of detailed statistics (e.g., 1,700 URLs per day during the campaign) indicates strong analytical capabilities.\n  - **Benefit**: Data-driven insights help organizations understand attack patterns and improve defenses.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Compliance Certifications and Regulatory Adherence**\nThe content does not explicitly mention compliance certifications or regulatory adherence. However, the detection and reporting of phishing campaigns align with general cybersecurity best practices and may indirectly support compliance with regulations such as:\n- **GDPR**: Protecting user data from phishing attacks aligns with GDPR requirements for data protection.\n- **ISO 27001**: Monitoring and incident response practices may support certification under this standard.\n- **Anti-Phishing Regulations**: Efforts to combat phishing align with industry standards and legal requirements.\n\n**Recommendation**: Include explicit mentions of compliance certifications (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2) and regulatory adherence to build trust with users.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **User-Focused Security Recommendations**\nThe content emphasizes practical user-focused guidance:\n1. **Verify Emails and Links**: Users are advised to slow down and carefully review emails and links before taking action.\n   - **Best Practice**: Educate users to hover over links to preview destinations and avoid suspicious URLs.\n2. **Avoid Phishing Triggers**: Warn users about the correlation between major events (e.g., free play announcements) and targeted phishing campaigns.\n   - **Best Practice**: Train users to recognize phishing tactics, such as fake giveaways or petitions.\n3. **Use of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: While not explicitly mentioned, enabling 2FA could prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.\n   - **Best Practice**: Encourage users to enable 2FA for their Square Enix accounts.\n4. **Report Suspicious Activity**: Users should report phishing attempts to the organization or platform.\n   - **Best Practice**: Provide a clear reporting mechanism and acknowledge user contributions to security.\n5. **Patch and Update Software**: Regularly update browsers, operating systems, and antivirus software to protect against vulnerabilities.\n   - **Best Practice**: Automate updates where possible and educate users on the importance of patches.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Technical Security Implementation Details**\n- **URL Filtering and Blocking**: The detection of 47,076 phishing URLs suggests the use of advanced URL filtering and categorization technologies.\n  - **Recommendation**: Implement web application firewalls (WAFs) and proxy servers to block malicious URLs.\n- **Phishing Page Detection**: The ability to identify fake login pages and forum posts indicates the use of machine learning or pattern recognition technologies.\n  - **Recommendation**: Use automated systems to scan for brand impersonation and fake content.\n- **Monitoring Non-Email Channels**: The content highlights the use of in-game chat (e.g., \"whisper\" feature) to spread phishing attacks.\n  - **Recommendation**: Monitor alternative communication channels (e.g., forums, social media, and in-game chat) for phishing activity.\n- **Threat Intelligence Sharing**: Sharing attack patterns (e.g., fake giveaways, login pages) helps organizations improve defenses.\n  - **Recommendation**: Participate in threat intelligence sharing programs to stay informed about emerging threats.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Data Protection Measures**\nWhile the content focuses on phishing detection and user awareness, implicit data protection measures include:\n- **Encryption**: Ensure all login pages and data transmission channels use HTTPS to protect user credentials.\n- **Secure Authentication**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add a layer of security beyond passwords.\n- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary user data to reduce the risk of exposure in case of a breach.\n- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct audits to identify vulnerabilities in systems and applications.\n\n**Recommendation**: Explicitly describe data protection measures, such as encryption protocols and secure storage practices, to reassure users.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Best Practices for End Users**\n1. **Verify Sources**: Ensure any email, message, or webpage is legitimate before providing credentials or downloading software.\n2. **Use Antivirus Software**: Install and regularly update antivirus tools to detect and block malicious downloads.\n3. **Avoid Suspicious Downloads**: Refrain from downloading software or files from untrusted sources, especially those promoted through forums or phishing pages.\n4. **Stay Informed**: Keep up-to-date with the latest phishing tactics and security advisories from trusted sources.\n5. **Use Password Managers**: Generate and store unique, complex passwords for each account to reduce the risk of credential compromise.\n6. **Enable Security Features**: Turn on security features like 2FA, browser extensions that block malicious sites, and email filters that detect phishing attempts.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThe content provides valuable insights into a phishing campaign and offers practical security recommendations for users. However, it could be enhanced by including explicit mentions of compliance certifications, technical implementation details, and data protection measures. By addressing these gaps, the analysis would provide a more comprehensive overview of security practices and reassure users of the organization's commitment to protecting their data.",
