Brazils data protection law Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados  LGPD  will come into effect February 15, 2020, requiring organizations to be in line with strict compliancy laws regarding consumers personal identifiable information. Once the law is implemented, the Data Protection Authority DPA will be responsible for enforcing the LGPD and interpretive guidelines. These guidelines, while very broad for now, will shape how the laws interpreted, implemented and enforced. So, its best we learn the basics. Who must comply with LGPD? Any individual or legal entity with data processing activities that Are carried out in Brazil Are for the purpose of offering or supplying goods or services in Brazil or relate to individuals located in Brazil Involve personal data collected in Brazil Who doesnt have to comply? LGPD does not apply to data processing carried out By a person for a strictly personal purpose Exclusively for journalistic, artistic, literary or academic purposes Exclusively for national security, national defense, public safety or criminal investigationpunishment activities LGPD draws great inspiration from GDPR and CCPA , but there are two differences Some anonymous data may be protected as personal data when used for profiling. Generally, anonymous data is exempt from LGPD, however, Article 12 states that it may be deemed personal data when it is used to enhance, build upon or create behavioral profiles about individuals. There are no incentives for data controllers to pseudonymize data  it is addressed under Article 13, which encourages public health research bodies to anonymize or pseudonymize health data. What happens when businesses breach LGPD law? They can face a fine of up to R50 million approximately 12 million USD or 2 percent of total revenue in Brazil, whichever is higher. LGPD is just the next step in global privacy laws, as Gartner states that by 2022, half of our planets population will have their personal information protected under local privacy regulations in line with the GDPR, up from a tenth today. Also, by 2025, at least 25 of the worlds nations will be in reciprocal adequacy agreement with the EU or China, up from a few countries today. What do we do? How do we comply with these new laws without killing the productivity of our company? Its time to use what we learned from GDPR. When looking back on how weve fared when GDPR came into effect, Gartner finds businesses face the following challenges due to growing privacy laws Global businesses are faced with new privacy compliance mandates within each major market. New and jurisdiction-specific privacy requirements are often addressed by costly independent projects with different approaches and levels of rigor. Ongoing monitoring efforts lack proactive and shared risk management plans, leading to redundant work and higher cost. GDPR came into force on May 25 th , 2018, meaning the 6 month-iversary was just a few weeks ago. Youd expect all businesses to gain compliancy in this time frame, however, a TrustArc study reports that by the end of 2018, only 76 EU, 76 U.K., and 68 U.S. businesses will be fully compliant. So why the low numbers of expected compliancy? Well, it seems that many businesses have tried to adopt legacy solutions. These have been proven ineffective, as information is too far spread out. A poll done by Citrix found that the average large UK business was reliant on 24 systems to manage and store personal data, with 21 using over 40 systems to do so. This kind of data sprawl can make compliancy extremely difficult, as knowledge about the location of customer information is limited and accessing and distributing this data to customers who request it can be a lengthy and expensive task. Continuous compliancy is key for a business to thrive in the new consumer privacy landscape  they need a solid foundation to build upon that enforces and facilitates compliancy privacy policies. Businesses need the next-gen solution, an all in one platform that strictly governs the security of the data, who can access it, and how it is distributed. As we learned with GDPR, LGPD is all or nothing, and it is best organizations adopt proactive practices that cover all LGPD laws, not just a subset. Businesses need user-enabled, governance-enabled, up-to-date security for every data point, every time. Enter Data443s ClassiDocs and ARALOC .

    "content": "**End-User Guide to Data Security and Protection under Brazil's LGPD**\n\n**1. Security Best Practices**\n   - **Data Classification:** Use tools like ClassiDocs to classify data into categories (e.g., public, internal, confidential). This helps prioritize protection.\n   - **Encryption:** Apply encryption to sensitive data. This ensures data remains unreadable to unauthorized parties, both during transit and at rest.\n\n**2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Regular Backups:** Schedule regular data backups. Ensure backups are stored securely and test restoration processes.\n   - **Role-Based Access:** Restrict data access to only necessary individuals. Implement RBAC to minimize unauthorized exposure.\n   - **Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation:** Collect and use only essential data for intended purposes. Avoid unnecessary data retention.\n\n**3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Phishing Awareness:** Train users to recognize phishing emails. Avoid opening suspicious links or attachments.\n   - **Password Management:** Use strong, unique passwords and enable MFA for all accounts.\n   - **Incident Reporting:** Encourage immediate reporting of security incidents to IT or compliance teams.\n\n**4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Insider Threats:** Implement trust-but-verify policies. Monitor access logs for anomalies.\n   - **Ransomware Protection:** Regularly update software and use endpoint detection tools. Segment networks to limit attack spread.\n\n**5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n   - **Transparency:** Communicate clearly with users about data use. Ensure privacy policies are accessible and understandable.\n   - **Consent Management:** Use tools like ARALOC for secure document sharing. Obtain informed consent before data collection.\n\n**6. When to Seek Additional Support**\n   - **Compliance Uncertainty:** Consult legal experts if unsure about LGPD requirements.\n   - **Incident Management:** Engage cybersecurity professionals for severe breaches.\n   - **Regular Audits:** Conduct periodic audits to ensure ongoing compliance and identify vulnerabilities.\n   - **Data Protection Officers (DPOs):** Appoint a DPO to oversee data protection strategies and compliance efforts.\n\nThis guide empowers users to protect their data effectively while complying with LGPD. By following these practical steps, users can enhance security without compromising productivity.",
