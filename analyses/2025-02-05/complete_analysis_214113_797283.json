Our continued outreach and direct communication is an essential element to our commitment to our customers. We have found that in many cases a virtual presentation is more effective, as we can reduce the distractions that other events carry with them. The topic of this series, Data Governance, Protection  Privacy, complements our solutions capability, and we feel it is necessary to share customer success stories and leading edge technology integrations with industry thought leaders as they consider and further develop their privacy and security strategies.
