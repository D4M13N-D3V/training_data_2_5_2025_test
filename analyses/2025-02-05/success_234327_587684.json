In a new sort of two-for-one malware service deal, Cyren has detected variants of the Kovter click-fraud malware being distributed with companion Cerber ransomware by the Kovter malware team. Once the recipient has unknowingly activated the downloader, both pieces of malware are installed and activated. After encrypting files on the victims machine, the companion ransomware will announce its presence  and the victim will evidently now be aware of the existence of that specific malware on their computer. However, the click-fraud Kovter malware is designed to operate silently, and definitely does not announce its presence. Which leaves us to speculate as to why a malware distributor would take the chance of their malware being discovered due to the noisy companion Cerber ransomware, for which we have three not-mutually-exclusive guesses Maximize System Resources for Click-Fraud  Cerber encrypts document or image type files in the system, leaving the victim with almost nothing to work on. This might induce the victim to leave the system idle, the ideal environment for the click-fraud malware to get to work. Distract the Victim Once Kovter has been installed, it becomes file-less and is not easy to detect, since most of its components are encrypted and stored in the registry. Therefore if the victim removes Cerber and restores their files, they may inadvertently leave Kovter installed anyway. And, instead of calling attention to a second malware, the victim will focus on the ransomware and think theyve already taken care of matters. Diversify Revenue If the user pays the ransom, then the Kovter team gets earnings from the ransomware  and per the above will likely continue running a system that has Kovter installed. You Werent There Delivery Failure Notifications Moving on to the mechanics of this particular scheme, spoofed package delivery failure emails allegedly from outfits like FedEx and UPS are commonly used themes in this malware distribution, as shown below. Delivery failure notification emails Downloader Script The first thing we notice about the included attachments is that they are both ZIP file attachments named Delivery-Details.zip, aside from their size, which is coincidentally 666 bytes for both. The ZIP file contains a folder with a javascript, using the same name as the ZIP file, which Cyren heuristically detects as JSDownldr.HX2!Eldorado. Figure 1 Attachment filefolder structure Inspecting the content of Delivery-Details.js shows a really small amount of code which iterates over a list of URLs, where it tries to download and execute another set of scripts. Further research reveals the group behind these malware outbreaks are taking extra precautions and are using multiple, possibly short-lived, servers to hide their activities. Figure 2 Downloader Script Running the script in a script emulator shows the following sequence of events Figure 3 Emulation sequence of events At lines 8-12 , we can see that JSDownldr.HX2!Eldorado was able to download script payload from one of the five URLs in its list, and upon download it immediately executes the script payload using Eval . The downloaded script payload appears to be obfuscated using string concatenation, which forms another downloader script using a similar list of URLs , from where it attempts to download and execute two EXE files. These files are usually downloaded from the same server as iterated in its URL list. Figure 4 Downloaded script payload Executable Payloads The first executable, exe1.exe , yet another variant of the Cerber Ransomware, which Cyren detects as W32Cerber.MX. The ransomware searches for and encrypts files in the affected system, leaving behind ransom notes in the encrypted folders and changes the desktop wallpaper as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5 Cerber ransom note screenshots The second executable, exe2.exe , disguised as the media player WinAmp, is a variant of Kovter, a malware family known to have evolved drastically over the years. This Kovter variant is heuristically detected by Cyren as W32Kovter.T.gen!Eldorado . Figure 6 W32Kovter disguised as WinAmp Similar to the known variants of this malware, it also employs file-less persistence in the system by hiding its components in the system registry, and also taking advantage of Windows Power Shell to load and execute its core module into memory. Since Windows Power Shell is a key component in its persistence mechanism, it will first check if Windows Power Shell is installed in the system, and if not will download and silently install the legitimate Windows patch installers for this Windows component. Once the malware has put everything in place to persist in the system, it proceeds to gather system information, and it sends this out to its control server at either hxxp185.117.72.90upload.php or hxxp185.117.72.90upload2.php . It uses a configuration file, which is encrypted and stored in the malware binary RCDATA resource. This configuration file contains a lot of the information needed by Kovter to run its malicious routines, including the download and control server links used during its initial routines.

    "content": "**Security Advisory: Protecting Against Phishing and Malware Attacks**\n\n**Introduction:**\nThis advisory addresses a recent phishing campaign distributing both Cerber ransomware and Kovter click-fraud malware through emails masquerading as delivery failure notifications. The goal is to provide clear, actionable steps to prevent and respond to such threats.\n\n**1. Email Safety Best Practices**\n- **Verify Senders:** Be cautious with unexpected emails, especially those claiming to be from delivery companies.\n- **Check for Red Flags:** Look for spelling and grammar mistakes, and hover over links to check their validity.\n- **Avoid Interacting:** Do not download attachments or click links from suspicious emails.\n\n**2. Backup/Data Protection**\n- **Regular Backups:** Schedule regular file backups on external drives and cloud storage.\n- **Offline Storage:** Store backup copies offline to protect against ransomware encryption.\n\n**3. Antivirus and Anti-Malware Measures**\n- **Install and Update Software:** Use reputable antivirus software and keep it updated.\n- **Enable Scans:** Run regular scans to detect hidden threats like file-less malware.\n\n**4. System Updates**\n- **Enable Automatic Updates:** Keep your OS and applications updated to patch vulnerabilities.\n\n**5. Network Precautions**\n- **Isolate Infected Devices:** Disconnect from the internet and network if a device is infected.\n- **Secure Wi-Fi:** Use strong passwords and consider disabling Wi-Fi when not in use.\n\n**6. Safe Browsing Habits**\n- **Avoid Suspicious Links:** Do not click on pop-ups or links from untrusted sources.\n- **Use Ad-Blockers:** Prevent accidental clicks on malicious ads.\n\n**7. Response to Infection**\n- **Stay Calm:** Disconnect from the internet to contain the threat.\n- **Seek Expert Help:** Contact IT or security professionals for assistance.\n- **Restore Backups:** Use backups to recover files, avoiding paying ransoms.\n- **Change Passwords:** Update credentials post-incident.\n\n**8. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Guard Personal Data:** Be cautious with sharing personal information online.\n- **Use VPNs:** Enhance privacy during public Wi-Fi use.\n- **Monitor Accounts:** Regularly check for unauthorized access.\n\n**9. When to Seek Help**\n- **Contact Professionals:** If uncertain or overwhelmed, reach out to IT or cybersecurity experts.\n\nBy following these guidelines, individuals can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing and malware attacks. Stay vigilant and proactive in protecting your digital environment.",
