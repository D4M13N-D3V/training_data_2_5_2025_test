November 2, 2017 The Requirement for Classification as part of GDPR Compliance Data privacy in the scope of the GDPR requires a clear understanding of the data you retain. What type of data is being stored, where it is being stored, and who is accessing it are the guiding principles, and classification of this data is your key to success and peace of mind. Data classification is critical to ensuring that you can identify unusual access patterns before they become an issue. Classification will give you deeper insights into where the data is being stored, and it will also provide full control and governance over each individual file. The latter is extremely important in light of the  right to be forgotten  rule, which allows your online customers to request that their file and all its associated information be removed from your system. In the years since the GDPR deadline was announced, many companies and IT admins have struggled to find a workflow that would make the governance of these individual data sets accessible without compromising other areas. To enable these tasks, a data classification solution was necessary in order to Quickly sort and classify all retained customer data Do so without adding to or complicating the IT workload Provide an easily deployable platform that works with any operating system Protect each dataset appropriately according to its classification Enable easy access to specific classifications of data for removal purposes Data classification is nothing new While all the recent talk about data classification may have you thinking that this is an entirely new problem, its roots go back to the Official Secrets Act of 1889 . This treatise was enacted to prevent the disclosure of official documents and information, mostly for governmental or financial reasons. Despite the fact that the concept and practice have been around for more than a century, it has not been widely adopted outside of public governance and those that do practice it often dont do it very well. However, there are plenty of reasons to adopt it now  the GDPR being a primary motivation  and the benefits to your companys management as well as its IT activities are many. Additionally, as data is increasingly stored in multiple locations and silos think Excel spreadsheets AND databases, or PDFs from the Fax machine and order entry systems  the ability to discover and classify datasets in hundreds of data types is increasingly seen as a default requirement. For instance, it is estimated that 85 or more of a companys stored data is either redundant, obsolete or trivial, meaning there is no practical need for you to store it at all. Removing this data has several advantages It will free up storage space and could help your IT systems to run more efficiently It will give you a more accurate snapshot of the viable data you are storing It may lead to more efficient indexing It will allow for faster access and recovery times But most of all, it will reduce your risk , and that is the main concern with the GDPR, as the fines for breaches and non-compliance are significant and could put your business continuity in peril.

Easy-to-Follow Security Best Practices**\n\n1. **Classify Your Data**:\n   - Regularly classify data based on sensitivity (e.g., public, internal, confidential, or restricted).\n   - Use tools like data classification software to automate and streamline this process.\n\n2. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**:\n   - Encrypt data at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access.\n\n3. **Implement Access Controls**:\n   - Restrict access to data based on roles and responsibilities (e.g., only employees who need the data for their job should have access).\n\n4. **Conduct Regular Audits**:\n   - Periodically review who has access to sensitive data and ensure permissions are up to date.\n\n5. **Use Backup Solutions**:\n   - Regularly back up critical data and ensure backups are secure and easily recoverable.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n\n1. **Data Minimization**:\n   - Only collect and store data that is necessary for your business operations.\n   - Avoid retaining redundant, obsolete, or trivial (ROT) data.\n\n2. **Implement Data Retention Policies**:\n   - Define how long you will keep data and ensure it is deleted securely when no longer needed.\n\n3. **Secure Storage Locations**:\n   - Store sensitive data in centralized, secure locations rather than scattered across multiple locations or devices.\n\n4. **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**:\n   - Use DLP tools to monitor and prevent unauthorized transfer of sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n\n1. **Train Employees**:\n   - Educate staff on data protection best practices and the importance of GDPR compliance.\n\n2. **Use Strong Passwords**:\n   - Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive systems.\n\n3. **Be Cautious with Email and Files**:\n   - Avoid sharing sensitive data via email or unsecured platforms.\n   - Use encrypted communication channels for sensitive information.\n\n4. **Monitor for Unusual Activity**:\n   - Keep an eye out for unusual access patterns or data transfers that could indicate a breach.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n\n1. **Phishing Attacks**:\n   - Train employees to recognize phishing emails and avoid clicking on suspicious links or attachments.\n\n2. **Insider Threats**:\n   - Monitor user activity for unauthorized access or data exfiltration.\n\n3. **Data Breaches**:\n   - Implement firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems to protect against external threats.\n\n4. **Lack of Awareness**:\n   - Regularly update employees on security policies and procedures.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n\n1. **Respect Data Subject Rights**:\n   - Ensure processes are in place to handle requests for data access, correction, or deletion (e.g., \"right to be forgotten\").\n\n2. **Anonymize Data Where Possible**:\n   - Use pseudonymization or anonymization techniques to protect personal data.\n\n3. **Third-Party Due Diligence**:\n   - Ensure partners and vendors comply with GDPR and other privacy regulations.\n\n4. **Transparency**:\n   - Clearly communicate how you collect, use, and protect data in your privacy policy.\n\n---\n\n### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n\n1. **If You Handle Sensitive Data**:\n   - Consult with a data security expert to ensure your practices meet compliance standards.\n\n2. **After a Breach**:\n   - Contact incident response professionals to investigate and mitigate the damage.\n\n3. **For Complex Systems**:\n   - Engage security analysts to review your infrastructure and identify vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **For Compliance Assistance**:\n   - Seek legal or security advisors to ensure you are meeting GDPR and other regulatory requirements.\n\n---\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches, improve compliance with GDPR, and protect your organization\u2019s reputation and assets."
