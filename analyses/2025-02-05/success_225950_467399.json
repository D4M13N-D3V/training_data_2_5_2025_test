We have recently found reports of malicious Powerpoint slides being sent through email, which are disguised as business opportunities or transactions. Figure 1.0 Email sample with Business Inquiry mentioning Covid-19 Figure 1.1 Email sample with Request-for-Quotation theme Analysis Once an unsuspecting user opens the PowerPoint slide attached to the email, PowerPoint will prompt the user about a potential security concern and lets user choose whether to enable or disable macros. If user chooses to enable macros, the malicious VBA macro is automatically executed upon closing of the PowerPoint slide, which is triggered by the use of a built-in VBA event named Auto_Close. The VBA code simply runs mshta to load and execute a malicious HTML application HTA with the use of a shortened URL hxxpsbit.ly8bz529ep5dc64gf2zxvd, which redirects to a pastebin link hxxpspastebin.comrawRi1gJLPQ. Figure 2.0 Behavior Tree It is good to point out that all HTA payloads used in this campaignattack uses the same obfuscation as shown below Figure 3.0 Obfuscated 1 st -level payload A quick de-obfuscation reveals code written in VBScript Figure 4.0 De-obfuscated 1 st -leval payload revealing VBScript code In just a few lines this initial payload attempts to execute a second level HTA payload from hxxppastebin.comrawBswfq2VB before creating auto-start entries, which in turn automatically executes the same second-level HTA payload without having to save any files to disk, hence making it file-less in a sense. Scheduled Task Task name Pornhub Runs every 80 minutes Runs mshta httppastebin.comrawBswfq2VB Autorun Registry Hive HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun Key START Value mshta httppastebin.comraw7dhzBwcm There at least three 3 different second-level payload links used, but the de-obfuscated form reveals the same VBScript code as shown below Figure 5.0 De-obfuscated 2 nd -level payload To put it into context, the 2 nd -level payload writes additional registry entries. The first one, being another auto-start registry entry, which executes VBScript code via mshta 1. This VBScript code executes a Powershell script, which is written as a registry entry too. Autorun Registry Hive HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun Key bin Value call to mshta, executing VBScript code Powershell Script Hive HKCUSoftware Key suckmyass Value Powershell script The Powershell script, as shown below, stored in the registry runs a quick check for internet-connectivity before proceeding to download and execute its final payload. Figure 6.0 Powershell script stored in the registry modified to be more readable Figure 6.1 Hex-encoded .Net Assembly Executable from hxxpspastebin.comraw5hRrW1Tr Figure 6.2 Base64 encoded Powershell script from hxxpspastebin.comrawqmxGASHG Figure 6.3 Decoded Powershell script with hex-encoded Gzip archive containing a .Net Assembly library, which is loaded by the Powershell script from the registry Final Payload Analysis The final payload consists of two 2 components, the first one is a .Net Assembly Library with an internal filename of Apple.dll and the second one, which is a .Net Assembly executable with an internal filename of success47a.exe . The .Net Assembly Library named Apple.dll is protected with ConfuserEx v1.0.0 as identified and de-obfuscated by the tool named de4dot2. Figure 7.0 ConfuserEx detection from de4dot Having it de-obfuscated, we can now look at what it actually does using dnSpy3. From the Powershell script, we saw that it calls the FreeDom method from the class named Givara with msbuild.exe and the hex-encoded .Net Assembly executable. Figure 8.0 Preview of de-obfuscated Apple.dll To keep it short, Apple.dll is process injector component, which loads msbuild.exe if it exists in the system and injects the decoded .Net Assembly executable into it. Unfortunately, the .Net Assembly executable that we were able to download from the pastebin link appears to do nothing. This might be an attempt for a file-less attack and it is possible that the content from the pastebin link has yet to be updated with a presumably malicious executable or future variants may use new links containing active and malicious payloads.

    "content": "# Data Security Guidance for Preventing PowerPoint Email Attack\n\n## 1. Security Best Practices\n\n- **Avoid Opening Unsolicited Attachments**: Refrain from opening attachments from unknown senders, especially PowerPoint files.\n- **Hover Over Links**: Check the source of links before clicking by hovering over them.\n- **Disable Macros by Default**: Keep macros disabled unless necessary. Only enable them for trusted sources.\n- **Regular Updates**: Ensure all software is up-to-date to protect against vulnerabilities.\n\n## 2. Data Protection Measures\n\n- **Endpoint Protection**: Use reputable antivirus software to detect known threats.\n- **Regular Backups**: Schedule regular backups to safeguard data in case of an attack.\n- **Limited User Privileges**: Use a non-admin account to minimize attack spread.\n\n## 3. Safe Usage Guidelines\n\n- **Caution with Emails**: Be wary of emails referencing timely events like COVID-19.\n- **Verify Senders**: Confirm sender identities before responding or opening attachments.\n- **Recognize Phishing**: Watch for typos and pressure tactics commonly used in phishing.\n\n## 4. Common Security Risks\n\n- **Macro Risks**: Malicious macros can execute harmful code, so extreme caution is advised.\n- **Phishing Attacks**: Be vigilant against emails exploiting current events.\n- **File-less Attacks**: These can be harder to detect as they don\u2019t store files locally.\n\n## 5. Privacy Protection Measures\n\n- **Monitor Accounts**: Regularly check for unauthorized access.\n- **Encryption**: Use encryption for sensitive data.\n- **Secure Sharing**: Only share personal information when necessary and with trusted parties.\n\n## 6. When to Seek Support\n\n- **Post-Incident**: Contact IT immediately if you've opened an attachment or enabled macros.\n- **System Behavior**: Seek help if your system behaves unusually, such as unexpected tasks.\n\n## Summary\n\n- **Stay Vigilant**: Exercise extreme caution with unsolicited emails and attachments.\n- **Use IT Tools**: Utilize approved software for optimal security.\n- **Seek Help Promptly**: Don\u2019t hesitate to contact support if unsure or detecting issues.\n\nBy following these guidelines, users can significantly enhance their security posture and protect against such threats effectively.",
