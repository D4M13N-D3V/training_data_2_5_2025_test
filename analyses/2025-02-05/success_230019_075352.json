The world is becoming increasingly digitized as more employees embrace a remote work model. Along with these changes, phishing attacks are growing by the minute and businesses, big and small, face the need to implement robust email security, which includes anti-phishing. When you hear the word phishing, the first thing that comes to mind is a fake login page hosted on a compromised website or a cheap web-hosting site. Those are usually available from an online-purchased phishing kit or downloaded from the Internet and modified. Some, however, are more complicated than that. What is Consent Phishing? Consent phishing is a type of phishing attack that takes advantage of OAuth 2.0 , which is an industry standard for authorization. The standard is used by companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Facebook to share information about their accounts with third-party sites and applications to gain access to content without having to share their login credentials. You have probably seen these buttons on websites or applications that you already use. These options make gaining access to content and interacting with sites and applications seamless. While you are granted access to a site or service, you simultaneously grant your consent for that site or service to access certain parts of your personal information and data. Clicking Sign up free with Microsoft leads you to the following page Clicking Sign-up free with Google leads you to another, but very similar page Read on, dont click Yes or Allow just yet. While digging through our Big Data of email threats detected by Cyren Inbox Security, we found this phishing email used in a consent phishing scam A simulated click on the FIX ERROR button sent us to the following OAuth URL hxxps login.microsoftonline.com commonoauth2v2.0authorize?statestring scope openid20profile20offline_access20user.read20mailboxsettings.readwrite20contacts.read20mail.send20mail.readwriteresponse_typecodeapproval_promptauto redirect_uri redirect url  client _id unique id It appeared that the OAuth site was hosted by a legitimate company providing the authorization service  in this case, it was login.microsoftonline.com . Such domains cannot be blocked because basic security tools typically protect them from detection so as to avoid false positives. The URL would include the following information redirect_uri  this is where the browser will redirect you after authorization. client_id  a unique identifier of the third-party app. Scope  a list of permissions requested by the third-party app. The scope entity would contain one or more of the following access rights offline_access  allows access to your data even when you are not using the app. read  allows the app to read your profile. read  allows the app to read contacts in your Contacts folder. send  allows the app to send emails on your behalf. readwrite  allows the app to read, update, create and delete emails in your mailbox. Imagine now reading your emails on a small screen of your mobile device and granting those permissions without paying close attention to what you agree to. Your email would get compromised in just a few taps and the next thing you know, youll be sending malware and ransomware to your friends and colleagues without being aware of it. Lets take a closer look at the permissions requested. Read and write to your mailbox settings means that threat actor could set up auto-forwarding rules to get copies of your emails that might contain confidential information such as bank accounts or invoices, for example. Read your contacts and Send emails as you means that threat actor can email your friends and colleagues pretending to be you, no spoofing needed. Read and write access to your emails means that threat actor can download and delete all your emails. Granting these types of access could serve as an entry-point and lead to a bigger attack like ransomware, BEC and vendor impersonation. With just a little bit of social engineering, a compromised account will make other users in the organization even more vulnerable  and the probability of them being tricked would increase dramatically. Mitigation Check out the following links to see the applications you have authorized to access your information   If you are an email admin, you should conduct a regular audit to monitor application permissions and auto-forwarding rules. Admins should always follow the Principle of Least Privilege, which means users and programs should only have the privileges and permissions necessary to complete a certain task. As threat actors have become more sophisticated in the attack methods they use, implementing comprehensive email and network security has become essential for protecting your company from reputational damage, brand damage, data loss, and more.

    "content": "**Security Advisory: Protecting Yourself from Consent Phishing**\n\n**Introduction:**\nConsent phishing is a sophisticated attack method that exploits the OAuth 2.0 protocol, used by major platforms like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, to trick users into granting unauthorized access to their accounts. This advisory provides practical guidance to help you protect yourself and your organization from such threats.\n\n**1. Understanding Consent Phishing:**\nConsent phishing occurs when attackers use fake authorization requests to gain access to your account permissions. These requests often appear legitimate, making them difficult to identify. Once granted, attackers can access your emails, contacts, and more, leading to further attacks like ransomware or BEC.\n\n**2. Security Best Practices:**\n- **Be Cautious with Third-Party Apps:** Avoid granting permissions to unfamiliar apps. Always verify the app's legitimacy.\n- **Review Permissions:** Regularly check which apps have access to your account. Revoke unnecessary permissions.\n- **Verify Requests:** Examine the sender and URLs carefully before approving any requests.\n\n**3. Data Protection Recommendations:**\n- ** Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure apps and users have only the necessary permissions.\n- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Add an extra layer of security to your accounts.\n- **Monitor Account Activity:** Regularly review your account for suspicious activity.\n\n**4. Safe Usage Guidelines:**\n- **Check URLs:** Hover over links to verify they lead to legitimate sites.\n- **Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Actions:** Public networks may not be secure for authorization processes.\n- **Educate Yourself:** Stay informed about phishing tactics to improve your defenses.\n\n**5. Common Risks and Prevention:**\n- **Phishing Emails:** Look for spelling mistakes, urgent tones, and unexpected requests.\n- **App Permissions:** Be wary of apps requesting excessive permissions.\n- **Hover Over Links:** Before clicking, verify the destination URL.\n\n**6. Privacy Protection Measures:**\n- **Regular Audits:** Periodically review authorized apps and revoke access as needed.\n- **Privacy Settings:** Adjust settings to limit data sharing.\n- **Encryption:** Use encryption for sensitive data.\n\n**7. When to Seek Additional Support:**\n- **Suspicious Activity:** Contact IT support if you suspect an attack.\n- **Compromised Account:** Immediately change passwords and secure your account if compromised.\n- **Security Tools:** Use anti-phishing solutions to enhance protection.\n\n**8. Steps to Revoke Access:**\n- **Google:** Visit [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) to manage permissions.\n- **Microsoft:** Check [Microsoft Account Permissions](https://account.microsoft.com/account/) to revoke access.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nVigilance is key in protecting yourself from consent phishing. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to such attacks. Stay informed, be cautious, and regularly review your account settings to ensure your security.\n\n**Stay Safe Online!**",
