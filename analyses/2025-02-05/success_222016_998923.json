CIS directly connects to Office 365, continuously detecting and automatically capturing phishing attacks that evade secure email gateways and arrive in a users inbox . This data provides insights about the scale and nature of evasive and targeted phishing threats, and why phishing continues to be a problem for many organizations despite investments in email security best practices and security awareness training. In July, the Incident and Response team identified nearly 20,000 confirmed email threats, which contained malicious content, and defied detection by third-party email security engines and the native security capabilities of Office 365. Key takeaways include Phishing continues to be the predominant email threat arriving in users mailboxes. Ransomware and business email compromise attacks are costly, but the data clearly illustrated that they are symptoms of previous successful phishing attacks. 93 contained phishing URLs 4 were business email compromise BEC or impostor emails 3 of messages included a malware attachment Figure 1 Types of email threats beyond the SEG Specialized detection and automated incident response are critical to eliminating threats before risky users do something they shouldnt. 97 of confirmed malicious incidents were detected before users read the messages. 94 of evasive threats were detected by Cyrens specialized engines and threat intelligence rather than helpdesk or SOC analysts. Threat intelligence is important but real-time analysis is critical for detecting evasive and zero-day email threats . 88 of evasive threats were detected with real-time techniques like machine learning. 6 were netted with proprietary threat intelligence or readily matched patterns of previous attacks heuristics. The remaining 6 were suspicious messages that required human analysis to confirm the detection User education matters but organizations must put it to good use, especially since most employees think phishing is ITs problem to solve. Providing the users with a tool for ad-hoc scans of emails before submitting them to the helpdeskSOC greatly reduces the volume of phishing alerts. 6 of total of confirmed phishing threats were triaged by end users rather than bogging down helpdesk or SOC personnel with basic or initial analysis. Of the messages submitted to the IDR platform, less than 2 were false positives. Phishing Attack of Note From July 16-17, Cyrens Incident and Response analysts noticed an attack that affected 192 users across 16 of our customers but with a few hallmarks of a highly targeted effort. This shows that some attackers have refined their tactics so they can automate attacks that used to require a high amount of manual effort. The senders name was spoofed and varied based on the target company . This is a typical trick used to associate the sender with an entity the users are likely to trust. The email subject related to an incoming voicemail. Again, this is typical. Phishing email subjects tend to mention voice messages, shipments, invoices, password resets, etc.  anything that creates some urgency but is also in keeping with our digital, mid-pandemic lives. There was no body text, just an attachment containing javascript. Criminals are increasingly putting phishing URLs or javascript in files to avoid the time of click protection offered by the SEG. The attachment contained code that would open an Office 365 phishing page that displayed the target companys logo and pre-completed the login form with the users email address. The fact that attackers were able to customize the look of the phishing page for each company is not something we see every day, at least not for an attack targeting so many companies at once. Figure 2 Targeted Office 365 phishing attack. The logo images and other identifying information have been redacted. This attack is a good example of the ability of bad actors to execute targeted attacks at scale through automation and abusing services and technologies designed to accelerate and secure digital transformation. Like many phishing attacks, this one targeted Office 365 credentials. Valid credentials would have allowed the attackers to access a variety of Office 365 services to launch devastating or email account compromise attacks and steal volumes of sensitive data. Inbox Detection and Response is a new category of anti-phishing solution designed to continuously detect and automatically respond to phishing, business email compromise, email account compromise, and other targeted email threats.

    "content": "**Security Recommendations Based on Phishing Threat Analysis**\n\n---\n\n**1. Security Best Practices**\n   - **Regular Updates:** Ensure all software, especially email clients and browsers, are updated to the latest versions.\n   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA for all critical accounts, particularly email and Office 365.\n   - **Advanced Security Solutions:** Implement solutions like Inbox Detection and Response (IDR) or Cloud Email Security Supplement (CESS) to enhance email security beyond traditional methods.\n   - **Security Audits and Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Encryption:** Use encryption for sensitive data both when stored and in transit.\n   - **Backups:** Regularly back up critical data and test the restoration process to ensure data integrity.\n   - **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Deploy DLP tools to monitor and prevent unauthorized data leakage.\n   - **Access Control:** Limit data access to only necessary personnel to minimize exposure.\n\n---\n\n**3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Link and Attachment Caution:** Hover over links to verify URLs and avoid opening attachments from unknown sources, especially executable files or javascript.\n   - **Password Management:** Use strong, unique passwords and consider a password manager.\n   - **Sender Verification:** Verify sender identities, especially for urgent or sensitive requests, through a separate communication channel.\n\n---\n\n**4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Phishing:** Train users to identify signs like typos, urgent requests, and unknown senders. Use email filtering and monitoring.\n   - **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** Verify requests through a separate channel to prevent falling victim to impersonation.\n   - **Malware/Ransomware:** Keep regular backups and use anti-malware tools to protect against infections.\n\n---\n\n**5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n   - **Encryption:** Use secure communication methods like HTTPS and S/MIME.\n   - **Data Sharing:** Minimize sharing of personal data and ensure websites are secure before entering sensitive information.\n   - **VPNs:** Use VPNs on public Wi-Fi to encrypt internet traffic and protect data.\n   - **Privacy Settings:** Regularly review and update privacy settings on all accounts.\n\n---\n\n**6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n   - **Incident Reporting:** Report suspicious emails or potential phishing attempts to IT immediately.\n   - **Account Compromise:** Contact IT if an account is suspected to be compromised.\n   - **Expert Engagement:** Seek security experts for incident response, testing, and strategy development.\n   - **Training Participation:** Engage in security awareness training and workshops to stay informed.\n\n---\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n   - **Response Planning:** Develop an incident response plan that includes automated detection tools for phishing incidents.\n   - **User Education:** While user vigilance is crucial, emphasize that security is a shared responsibility.\n   - **Attachment Scanning:** Use tools to scan attachments before opening, especially for javascript files.\n   - **Account Monitoring:** Regularly monitor email accounts for unauthorized access using notifications and activity reviews.\n\nBy following these guidelines, organizations and individuals can enhance their security posture and effectively mitigate the risks posed by phishing and other email-borne threats.",
