The terms of the transaction were not disclosed. What is Centurion  Recognized as the leading technical component to comply with major requirements for the new mandates from the Cybersecurity  Infrastructure Security Agency CISA as mandated by the White House  Biden Administration. Long-time patent owner of RebootRestore system technology for virus attack  ransomware recovery, SmartShield  .

Why it matters Expected to close at the same time as the imminent major market uplist. Ransomware is the 1 cyber threat to businesses in 2021, with no indications of changing. Combined with other capabilities Classification, Discovery, Migration, Encryption  offering becomes wholly unique and incredibly valuable to customers. Acquisition will deliver valuable intellectual property and patents, customers, and extensive partner portfolio and integrations to Data443. Continued product offerings for the consumer marketplace, which presents significant growth opportunities. Available for on-premises and via Cloud SaaS Deployments Jason Remillard, Founder and CEO of Data443 commented, The effects of the SolarWinds hack, Colonial Pipeline attack, JBS Food processor shutdown and CNA insurance attack  to only mention a very select few  continue to demonstrate an ongoing and pervasive threat to all nations and all citizens in high-risk scenarios. This is no longer a game played by script kiddies  these attacks are malicious, callous, and highly damaging. Just last Friday, I received an urgent call from a partner, who in turn had received an even more urgent call from a large power generation organization based in the US. Due to the new CISA guidance as directed by the White House, this organization had to both report on its current cyber response state AND have a full remediation plan in place  regardless of cost  by this Thursday. Similar scenarios are playing out daily across America  and wont be for just pipeline and nuclear power providers. This will be for banks, hospitals, state and local government  anywhere there is a risk to life, freedom, or financial resources, continued Mr. Remillard. Theft, extortion, leakage of employee and customer data, and mass downtime are some of the most damaging activities that can be subjected to any organization. Indeed, some do not even survive. Our mission has always been to discover, categorize and protect all data. Centurion fits perfectly into our mission. Combined with our existing commercial offerings, there is a great fit with our open-source community organizations which are both commercial over 8,000 now and pure open-source over 450,000. The patented technology, the additional pure EBIT and existing massive customer base, the staff and timing are perfect for Data443 as we continue to grow and gain velocity to our eventual senior market uplist. The Data443 team has all of the extra capabilities weve been looking for in a partner and ultimately  an acquirer. Fantastic product line, excellent execution in the marketplace, and a storyline that matches up with customer needs. We are excited to be a part of this story and look forward to the future! commented Tripp Manheimer, President of Centurion Technologies. The transaction will complete the terms of an OEM agreement with Centurion executed in early 2021. Closing is subject to due diligence and traditional closing conditions. Anticipated closing will be immediately after the major market uplist. About Data443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. Data443 Risk Mitigation, Inc.

Here's a concise and actionable guide to help you safeguard your information:\n\n### 1. Security Best Practices\n- **Regular Updates:** Keep your software, operating system, and applications updated to patch security vulnerabilities.\n- **Strong Passwords:** Use passwords of at least 12 characters, combining letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid reused passwords.\n- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA, especially for critical accounts, using methods like authenticator apps or hardware tokens.\n\n### 2. Data Protection Recommendations\n- **Backups:** Follow the 3-2-1 rule: three copies, two different media, one off-site. Consider cloud backups for added security.\n- **Encryption:** Use encryption for sensitive data, both at rest (e.g., SSD encryption) and in transit (e.g., HTTPS, VPNs).\n\n### 3. Safe Usage Guidelines\n- **Caution with Downloads:** Avoid installing software from untrusted sources. Read user agreements carefully.\n- **Phishing Awareness:** Verify links and attachments before interacting. Be wary of urgent or suspicious emails.\n\n### 4. Common Security Risks and Prevention\n- **Ransomware:** Regularly back up data and avoid opening unknown emails. Use anti-ransomware tools.\n- **Insider Threats:** Limit data access to necessary personnel. Monitor user activity for unusual behavior.\n- **Physical Security:** Secure devices and use cable locks. Be vigilant in public spaces to prevent theft.\n\n### 5. Privacy Protection Measures\n- **App Permissions:** Review and restrict unnecessary app access to your data.\n- **Social Media Caution:** Share personal information judiciously. Enable privacy settings on platforms.\n- **Privacy Tools:** Utilize VPNs for public Wi-Fi and consider ad blockers to reduce tracking.\n\n### 6. When to Seek Additional Security Support\n- **Breach or Attack:** Contact IT or security professionals immediately if you suspect a breach or malware attack.\n- **Data Loss:** Seek expert help if you lose access to critical data.\n- **Uncertainty:** Consult with security experts if unsure about protection measures or suspicious activity.\n\n### Conclusion\nProactive measures are key to data security.
