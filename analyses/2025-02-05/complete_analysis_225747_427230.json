  "content": "Search Free Trial Get Demo IRS Scams 2022 April 7, 2022 Tax scams are so prevalent that the United States Internal Revenue Service has published a very long FAQ page to warn people of the risks. As we approach the peak of the income tax season in the United States, we can expect cyber-criminals to increase their efforts to intercept tax refund payments and steal personally identifiable information like Social Security Numbers. Case in point, Cyren threat researchers detected two recent spikes in phishing URLs related to the IRS. In total, Cyren detected 13,295 active tax scam URLS in March. Many of these URLS were first spotted in January and February as cyber-criminals deployed their phishing kits and tested their email content in preparation. Figure 1. Number of IRS-related phishing threats per day To evade detection, criminals will shorten the URLs using well-known services like LinkedIn. Many of the URLs that Cyren detected were shortened in this way. For example, the shortened URL  might lead to any one of these fraudulent pages      The webgetpaymentirs.com domain was registered very recently. Newly created domains should be viewed with suspicion. At the time of writing this article, the web server was hosted in Microsofts cloud. This is another common evasion tactic. Most businesses and Internet Service Providers will not block traffic to clouds owned by Microsoft, Google, or Amazon. The good news is these cloud hosting providers have robust fraud prevention processes and work hard to quickly spot and remove phishing and malware sites. The URLs were delivered via phishing emails of varying sophistication. Based on the reference to IRS Form K-1 and the dollar amount, its clear the criminals behind this campaign were targeting businesses. The first sample email included the phishing URL in an encrypted attachment, making detection more difficult. Also, note that the email body was customized to target a specific company the second redacted string is the company name. Figure 2. Targeted phishing email The second sample did not come from a targeted campaign, combining tactics of spam and phishing. Its reminiscent of the Nigerian Prince and Iraqi Lottery scams of old. Figure 3. Phishing and spam combined Note that several phishing URLs were hosted by the same domain, webgetpaymentirs.com. Each URL was for a different web page or input form, following a similar structure to phishing kits weve analyzed before. In this case, the links led potential victims to various web forms designed to harvest Personally Identifiable Information and payment details, but only after acknowledging a rather ironic warning message Figure 4.

Victims of this scam are at high risk of identity theft Figure 6. Credit card details are always a favorite target of criminals Major events like business and individual tax filing deadlines will always lead to an increase in targeted scams. Businesses need to put in place reasonably controls to prevent employees from exposing payment details or being duped into making payments to fraudsters. An easy win is to set an acceptable level of financial loss and require the 2-person rule for any transaction above that threshold. For example, if the threshold is 5,000 but your corporate card has a limit of 30,000 it should require a quorum of employees to approve entering the card details in a website. Of course, this kind of process is meant to complement sound automated security that spots and removes suspicious messages from users mailboxes before they fall victim to scams.

      "user_guidance": "### Practical Security Guidance for Data Protection and Privacy\n\nAs we approach tax season in the United States, cybercriminals are increasingly targeting individuals and businesses with IRS-related phishing scams and fraud schemes. Below is a set of easy-to-follow security recommendations to help you protect yourself, your business, and your sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Security Best Practices**\n- **Be cautious with unsolicited emails or messages**: The IRS will never initiate contact with you via email, text, or social media to request personal or financial information. Verify the authenticity of any communication by contacting the IRS directly.\n- **Verify URLs before clicking**: Check the web address to ensure it is legitimate and not slightly altered (e.g., \"irs.gov\" vs. \"irsgov.com\"). Avoid clicking on shortened URLs (e.g., LinkedIn shortcuts).\n- **Use multi-factor authentication (MFA)**: Enable MFA for all accounts, especially tax-related services, email, and financial platforms.\n- **Keep software updated**: Regularly update your operating system, browser, and security software to patch vulnerabilities.\n- **Use strong, unique passwords**: Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts. Consider using a password manager to securely store credentials.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Encrypt sensitive data**: Use encryption for files containing Social Security Numbers, tax documents, or financial information before sharing them.\n- **Back up your data**: Regularly back up critical files to an external drive or a secure cloud service to protect against ransomware or accidental deletion.\n- **Limit data sharing**: Only share personal or business information with trusted individuals or organizations. The IRS will not ask for payment or sensitive details via email or text.\n- **Monitor financial accounts**: Regularly check bank and credit card statements for unauthorized transactions.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Avoid suspicious attachments or links**: Do not open attachments or click on links from unfamiliar sources, especially those claiming to be from the IRS.\n- **Use secure communication channels**: If you need to discuss taxes or payments, use official IRS portals or contact them directly through their website.\n- **Educate employees**: For businesses, train employees to recognize phishing emails and report suspicious activity to IT or security teams.\n- **Use antivirus and anti-phishing tools**: Install and regularly update antivirus software to detect and block malicious content.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Phishing and social engineering**: Criminals may impersonate the IRS or other trusted organizations to steal credentials or payment details. Be skeptical of urgent or threatening messages.\n- **Fake IRS websites**: Avoid entering personal or payment information on websites that appear suspicious or unverified.\n- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: Criminals may target businesses with emails that appear to be from executives or vendors requesting payments. Always verify requests through a separate communication channel.\n- **Scams involving tax refunds**: Be cautious of communications offering unexpected tax refunds or demanding immediate payment.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Minimize sharing of sensitive information**: Only share personal or financial details when necessary and through secure channels.\n- **Use a VPN**: When accessing sensitive information on public Wi-Fi, use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection.\n- **Shred unnecessary documents**: Dispose of tax-related documents securely to prevent identity theft.\n- **Enable privacy settings**: Review your social media and online accounts to ensure sensitive personal information is not publicly accessible.\n\n---\n\n### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- **Report suspicious activity**: If you receive a phishing email or believe you have been targeted by a scam, report it to the IRS and your email provider.\n- **Contact IT or security teams**: If you are unsure about the legitimacy of an email or link, seek input from your organization\u2019s security team.\n- **Use professional services**: For businesses, consult with cybersecurity experts to implement advanced protections, such as email filtering and threat detection tools.\n- **File a complaint**: If you are a victim of identity theft or fraud, file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and consider placing a fraud alert on your credit reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Note**\nTax season is a peak time for cybercriminals to exploit individuals and businesses. By staying vigilant, following these security best practices, and educating yourself and your team, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to IRS-related scams and other cyber threats. Always err on the side of caution and verify the legitimacy of any communication before taking action."
