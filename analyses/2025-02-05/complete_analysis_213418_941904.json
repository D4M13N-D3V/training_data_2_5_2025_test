How do we do it? Case Study The remainder of the report includes a content analysis report with graphs for Through our years of experience, it has become evident that the Document Type of a record will drive many of these concerns and the actions taken to secure sensitive information. Each Document type will have a level of risk associated with it based on the usual contents of that document type. By using policies to identify the document type, the usual level of risk, whether that document type tends to contain PII, and analyzing the file location, we can create a Document Profile and score. Using these profiles and policies within the Data Identification Manager tool, each repository can be scanned and have a score determined. Using these outputs, the business you can make a meaningful correlation to the document type profile of Security, Sensitivity, Personal Data, and ROT.
