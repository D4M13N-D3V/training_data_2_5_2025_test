OTCPK ATDS, a leading data security and privacy software company, wishes everyone a very happy new year, while reminding everyone that the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA has taken effect. What is the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA? Signed into law by California Governor Jerry Brown on June 28, 2018 and effective today, the CCPA is a comprehensive data privacy law, which is comparable to privacy laws in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the Canada The Digital Privacy Act. The CCPA is designed to strengthen data security requirements for businesses and other organizations and give consumers  California residents living in the state for anything other than a temporary or transitory purpose  more control over their personal information. The CCPA accomplishes this by creating a number of new consumer rights. These rights must be protected by organizations in order to avoid major fines. Jason Remillard, Founder and CEO of Data443 stated, What many businesses are learning is that much like the GDPR, the CCPA affects businesses outside of the state of California as well due to its size and scope. I believe that its only a matter of time before a federal law is adopted that will create a standard for customer data collection throughout the country. Microsoft has already announced a national-level compliance program for CCPA-level services, in 2020. I expect others to follow suit in the absence of a national legislation. A California Government impact assessment estimates that businesses will allocate for CCPA activities approximately 50k, 100k, 450k, 2M for businesses of 20, 100, 500 and over 500 employees respectively. How does Data443 help businesses become compliant in CCPA? GDPR and CCPA requirements consist of more than just preparation. You need process and technology in order to maintain your compliance with the CCPA and other state-level privacy legislation that is already slated to come in 2020 NV, WA, etc..
