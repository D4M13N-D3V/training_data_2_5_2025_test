This weeks post is short but involves two critical and related terms authentication and authorization. These terms are frequently confused mainly because they are so closely connected and the fact that the two words are so similar. Simply stated authentication is verifying that someone is who they claim to be while authorization is deciding which resources a user should be able to access, and what they should be allowed to do with those resources. Note not to be too pedantic but technically authentication is really validating the credential that has previously been created rather than the actual identity of the person. Well explore this idea in a later post. Obviously before we can authorize a user access to certain resources we first need to be sure that they are who they say they are. Therefore authentication and authorization are inextricably linked. An often used analogy to explain the difference between authentication and authorization involves a traveler arriving at passport control in a foreign country. The traveler presents their passport hoping to gain access to the country. The border control agent reviews the document and accepts that the traveller is who they say they are. Once the traveler has been authenticated he is then authorized access to the foreign country. Finally, there are a number of important protocols to understand in the world of authentication and authorization.
