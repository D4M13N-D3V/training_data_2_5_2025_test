      "user_guidance": "### **End-User Guidance on Data Security and Protection**\n\nTo help you stay safe online and protect your data, here are practical, easy-to-follow recommendations:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Security Best Practices**\n- **Verify Links Before Clicking**: Always check the URL of a link before clicking. Hover over the link to see the full address. Legitimate links from companies like Adobe will direct to their official domains (e.g., `spark.adobe.com` or `www.adobe.com`).\n- **Use Strong Passwords**: Create unique, complex passwords for each account. Use a password manager to securely store them.\n- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add an extra layer of security by using MFA whenever possible.\n- **Keep Software Updated**: Regularly update your operating system, browser, and other software to protect against vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Back Up Your Data**: Regularly back up important files to a secure cloud service or an external drive.\n- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use encryption for sensitive files or communications to prevent unauthorized access.\n- **Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Tasks**: Refrain from accessing sensitive accounts or sharing personal data when using public Wi-Fi.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Be Cautious with Unsolicited Messages**: Phishing campaigns often mimic legitimate companies like Adobe. If you receive an unexpected email or message, do not click on links or download attachments.\n- **Use Official Channels for Support**: If you receive a message claiming to be from Adobe, contact their official support directly to verify its legitimacy.\n- **Monitor Account Activity**: Regularly check your account settings and login history for any suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Phishing Risks**: Phishing emails or messages mayredirect you to fake websites that steal your credentials. Always verify the sender\u2019s identity and the URL before interacting.\n- **Malicious Downloads**: Avoid downloading files or software from untrusted sources, as they may contain malware.\n- **Fake Websites**: Scammers may create websites that look like legitimate ones (e.g., Adobe Spark pages) to steal your login credentials. Ensure the URL is legitimate before entering any personal information.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Limit Personal Data Sharing**: Avoid sharing sensitive personal or financial information unless necessary and only through secured channels.\n- **Use Privacy Settings**: Adjust privacy settings on your accounts to restrict who can access your information.\n- ** Disposable Email Addresses**: Consider using a disposable email address for signing up for free trials or services to minimize exposure of your primary email.\n\n---\n\n### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- If you suspect a phishing attempt or have clicked on a suspicious link, contact your organization\u2019s IT or security team immediately.\n- If your personal account has been compromised, change your password, enable MFA, and monitor your account activity.\n- If you receive a message claiming to be from a company (e.g., Adobe), reach out to their official support to verify its legitimacy.\n\n---\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing campaigns and other cyber threats. Stay vigilant and prioritise your online safety!"
