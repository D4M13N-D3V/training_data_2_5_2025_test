We addressed FIDO Fast IDentity Online last year in this series. If you remember FIDO is an authentication technology developed back in 2013 with the stated goal of replacing passwords. FIDO was founded to develop technical specifications to improve the interoperability and adoption of various hardware-based authentication techniques. The original standard was made up of two sets of specifications or user experiences for authentication  UAF Universal Authentication Framework and U2F Universal Second Factor. UAF deals with passwordless authentication, while U2F addresses the second factor authentication, typically with a Yubico type of token. FIDO2 is new for 2018 and it is quite exciting. The term is a shorthand for the combination of two developing standards, W3Cs WebAuthn and FIDOs CTAP Client to Authenticator Protocol standard. These new standard would not be very useful if they did not come with platform support, and since this one intends to bridge the desktop world with the mobile world, browsers and operating systems are both critical. Luckily, this one had extra time in the standards oven more than 2 years and it came out fairly fully-baked with Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Android  Windows 10 supporting the standard now or later in 2018. Apple is now part of the WebAuthN working group, so there are high hopes they will join the party, but mums the word at this moment. So why is this important, and why does Resilient care? Weve been implementing the newest authentication techniques for our clients for years most recently adding U2F tokens for admins for a healthcare cloud company but we dont like to limit customers to only certain supporting browsers. Standards are cumbersome and slow, but excellent when a good design is adopted widely. In this case FIDO2 is just better multi-factor than other options because it removes many of the common security threats including phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks and misuse of credentials, and since a users credential never leaves the users authenticator it is much more difficult to steal the credential. That being said, it has not been entirely smooth sailing for FIDO. Microsoft skipped the original FIDO standard but now they support WebAuthN, Apple is a big question mark, and many implementers in the industry have been on the sidelines waiting for more clarity on the communication options for U2F NFC, BLE and migration from USB-A to USB-C. Also, the industry has seen a lot of adoption of other MFA in the past five years and good enough MFA though still vulnerable to intercept or carrier hacks has become an impediment to the better FIDO2 approach. Cost and complexity are the final, and most important, drag on adoption. FIDO2  WebAuthN is a big stride in the right direction. It is targeting a broader scope of authentication problems and doing so with a longer list of compatible platforms. We believe that the tipping point for FIDO2 will happen, but exactly when is anyones guess. We expect more announcements on FIDO2 in 2018 a free mobile authenticator from Google, perhaps so watch our blog for the latest.

    "content": "**Security Guidance Based on FIDO 2.0**\n\n1. **Adopt FIDO2 for Enhanced Security:**\n   - Transition to FIDO2 authentication whenever possible to eliminate password vulnerabilities and mitigate risks like phishing.\n\n2. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**\n   - Use MFA alongside FIDO2 to add an extra security layer. Enable MFA on critical accounts to enhance protection.\n\n3. **Educate on Phishing Risks:**\n   - Train users to identify phishing attempts by being cautious with links and verifying sources before clicking.\n\n4. **Understand FIDO2 Devices:**\n   - Use security keys or biometric authentication with FIDO2, as they keep credentials secure by not transmitting them.\n\n5. **Follow Safe Usage Guidelines:**\n   - Keep software updated to protect against vulnerabilities.\n   - Use privacy-focused browsers to enhance security.\n\n6. **Seek Support When Needed:**\n   - For those less tech-savvy, seek assistance from security experts for setup and troubleshooting.\n\n7. **Mitigate Common Risks:**\n   - Backup credentials and have a plan in case of lost devices to prevent lockout.\n\n8. **Protect Privacy:**\n   - Choose services supporting FIDO2 to reduce reliance on less secure methods, enhancing overall privacy.\n\n9. **Encourage Organizational Support:**\n   - Organizations without expertise should consult security professionals for implementing FIDO2 solutions.\n\nBy following these guidelines, users can leverage FIDO2 to enhance security and protect against common threats effectively.",
