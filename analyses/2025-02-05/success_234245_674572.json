Letters and symbols combine and form words to capture ideas. These ideas are strung together in sentences and paragraphs to increase knowledge, share feelings, and inspire others with new and fascinating ways of thinking. Every language has a rhythm and understanding developed through syntax, structure, and grammar. This holds true in digital languages as well. From the  symbol denoting an email address to the hashtag  marking a Twitter string lifeisawesome to the emoji text from your teen telling you she is shocked, digital languages are changing how we communicate. The language of coding is no exception. Regular expressions are used in multiple coding languages Perl, PHP, Java, etc. as a way of defining patterns in information using special symbols. These expressions are used to identify or extract information through establishing and enforcing a common format. For example, Social Security numbers are always nine numbers with two dashes 111-11-1111 phone numbers with area codes are ten numbers with two parentheses and a dash 777 777-7777. Regular expressions set the parameters for the correct format. Regular expressions are often paired with field masks to show the proper format in the field being populated. When you enter a telephone number online digits only and the parentheses and dash magically as you enter the number, the software is using regular expression with a field mask. When your applications and software incorporate regular expressions, you are able to easily navigate through data residing on your ECM for collection, deletion, or search and replace.
