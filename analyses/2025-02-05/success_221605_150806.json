Interestingly, they used many techniques to make the attack more evasive. Related Microsoft reports a leap in attack sophistication The Attack On Thursday, November 26, at 0951 UTC, an immense phishing campaign started targeting more than two thirds of the organizations using Cyren Inbox Security at once. It became one of the biggest malicious attacks in November by the number of phishing emails totally distributed. The emails were sent as if from a Zoom account ,while spoofing the target organizations domain as a sender domain. This made the email look trustworthy, as if it was sent internally inside the enterprise. But once checking the authentication results, the sender mail address was spoofed dkimfail no key for signature dmarcfail failure in both SPF and DKIM compauthfail reason601 marked by Office365 ATP as spoofed. Attackers used the SendGrid infrastructure for emails to reach the maximum number of victims mailboxes sender IP is 168.245.36.62, which is a SendGrid mail server. The email itself contained a message urging the recipient to Review a video conferencing invitation.

This query opened a fake Microsoft 365 login page hosted on an appspot.comdomain. Example of the phishing landing page hxxpscebxbhilakscgyzdcjdilniduq-dot-chrome-backbone-296016.uc.r. appspot.com ?utm_campaignwebsiteutm_sourcesendgrid.comutm_mediumemail The phishing was distributed by abusing a high-Alexa uTest domain , which redirected to the URL with auto-generated subdomains hosted on another high-Alexa domain appspot.com. Each URL contained sendgrid.com as a UTM source, which attackers could misuse to visualize and measure the impact of the sent emails on the potential victim.
