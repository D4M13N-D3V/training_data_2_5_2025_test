It weighs about 3 \u00bd pounds and consists of two hemispheres, 100 billion neurons, and 100 trillion synapses the command and control center for each of us. The brain controls autonomous functions like heartbeats and brainwaves, but it also allows us to learn through its unequaled capacity for identifying and analyzing patterns. Intelligence is essentially the ability to store patterns in our memory. Recognizing and analyzing patterns makes us uniquely human. That is, until computers can do it better. When IBM developed machines to recognize and analyze chessboard patterns, the machines could learn to defeat grandmasters. Today, IBMs Watson is starting to diagnose diseases Google and Tesla vehicles are learning to drive autonomously. This is all possible through data discovery. At its core, data discovery is the process of extracting actionable patterns from data. It starts with aggregated data, identifies outliers, and results in extracted data to be leveraged in specific circumstances. Data discovery helps you develop real world solutions based on specific data provided by established patterns. That Doesnt Sound Too Hard And, it isnt  if you have the right tool. The problem is the sheer amount of data. Estimates predict daily data generation at 2.5 billion gigabytes per day, and 90 of the worlds collective data has been produced in just the last two years. In a 2016 study , Veritas found that of the information stored and processed globally, 52 is dark no one really knows what it holds and another 33 is redundant, obsolete or trivial ROT and useless. More telling is the fact that employees spend up to 30 of their workday 2.5 hours searching for useful data. Can any company tame the chaos of information overload? Is there a way to locate all files and to evaluate each ones importanceif anyto the business? And, is it even possible to create an ongoing, sustainable system to manage files today and in the future? Yes! Information managementalso known as information Governance or IGis not only possible but accessible.

      "user_guidance": "### Security Guidance for Data Protection and Privacy\n\nThis guidance is designed to help you protect your data, ensure privacy, and maintain security best practices. Follow these practical recommendations to safeguard your information and systems.\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Security Best Practices**\n- **Use Strong Access Controls**  \n  Limit access to sensitive data to only those who need it. Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that users can only view or modify data relevant to their job functions.  \n- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**  \n  Encrypt data both at rest (stored) and in transit (being sent over a network). Use strong encryption protocols like AES-256 or TLS 1.2/1.3.  \n- **Regularly Audit and Monitor Data Access**  \n  Periodically review who has access to your data and ensure it aligns with current roles and responsibilities. Monitor logs for unusual activity.  \n- **Backup Data Regularly**  \n  Perform regular backups and store them securely, both on-premises and in the cloud. Test backups periodically to ensure they can be restored.  \n- **Keep Software Updated**  \n  Regularly update operating systems, applications, and tools to protect against vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates where possible.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Classify Data by Sensitivity**  \n  Categorize data into levels of sensitivity (e.g., public, internal, confidential, or restricted). Apply stronger protections to more sensitive data.  \n- **Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Tools**  \n  Employ DLP tools to identify and monitor sensitive data. These tools can help prevent accidental or intentional leaks.  \n- **Secure Endpoints**  \n  Ensure all devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones) used to access or store data are secure. Use endpoint protection software and enable features like disk encryption (e.g., BitLocker).  \n- **Implement Data Retention Policies**  \n  Define how long data should be kept and ensure unnecessary or redundant data is deleted securely. This reduces the risk of exposing obsolete data.  \n- **Prepare for Data Breaches**  \n  Develop an incident response plan to address potential breaches. Train employees on how to respond quickly and effectively.  \n\n---\n\n#### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Avoid Phishing and Social Engineering Attacks**  \n  Be cautious with unsolicited emails, links, or attachments. Verify the sender\u2019s identity before taking any action.  \n- **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**  \n  Avoid using the same password across multiple accounts. Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.  \n- **Be Mindful of Sensitive Data Sharing**  \n  Only share sensitive data when absolutely necessary, and use secure methods like encrypted email or secure file-sharing platforms.  \n- **Log Out of Sessions**  \n  Always log out of applications and systems when finished, especially on shared devices.  \n- **Use Secure Wi-Fi**  \n  Avoid accessing sensitive data over public or unsecured Wi-Fi networks. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) if you must connect to public Wi-Fi.  \n\n---\n\n#### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Dark Data Risks**  \n  Dark data (unused or unstructured data) can pose risks if it contains sensitive information. Use tools like **FileFacets** to identify, classify, and manage dark data.  \n- **Insider Threats**  \n  Monitor for unauthorized changes to data or unusual access patterns. Establish clear policies for data handling and termination procedures for departing employees.  \n- **Data Breaches**  \n  Implement measures like multi-factor authentication (MFA), encryption, and regular security audits to reduce the risk of breaches.  \n\n---\n\n#### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Anonymize or Pseudonymize Data**  \n  Remove or mask personally identifiable information (PII) where possible to protect individual privacy.  \n- **Ensure Compliance with Regulations**  \n  Familiarize yourself with data protection laws like GDPR, CCPA, or HIPAA, depending on your jurisdiction or industry. Ensure your data practices comply with these regulations.  \n- **Conduct Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs)**  \n  Evaluate how data is collected, stored, and shared to identify and mitigate privacy risks.  \n- **Train Employees on Privacy Practices**  \n  Educate your team on the importance of data privacy and how to handle sensitive information responsibly.  \n\n---\n\n#### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- **During a Security Breach**  \n  If you suspect or confirm a breach, contact your IT security team or a professional incident response service immediately.  \n- **For Complex Compliance Requirements**  \n  If you\u2019re unsure how to comply with data protection regulations, consult with a data privacy expert or legal advisor.  \n- **When Facing Sophisticated Threats**  \n  If you detect advanced persistent threats (APTs) or ransomware attacks, seek help from cybersecurity professionals.  \n- **For Unfamiliar Technologies**  \n  If you\u2019re implementing new tools or systems, consult with vendors or security experts to ensure proper security configurations.  \n\n---\n\nBy following these guidelines, you\u2019ll be better equipped to protect your data, maintain privacy, and reduce the risk of security incidents. Remember, security is an ongoing process\u2014stay proactive and regularly review your practices to adapt to new threats and technologies."
