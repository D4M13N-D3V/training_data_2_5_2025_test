OTCPK ATDS, a leading data security and privacy software company for ALL THINGS DATA SECURITY, today announced that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has declared the Companys registration statement on Form S-1 File No. 333-251752 effective as of January 26, 2021. Such declaration does not imply that the SEC has approved or opined on the merits of the offering or of the Company. The S-1 registration statement relates to the resale or other disposition by Triton Funds, LP Triton and its transferees of shares of our Common Stock, comprised of i up to 166,666,667 shares of our common stock that may be purchased by Triton and, ii up to 100,000,000 shares of our Common Stock to be issued to Triton upon its exercise of warrants issued to Triton. We will not receive proceeds from the sales, if any, of the shares by Triton. However, the Company will receive up to 1,000,000 from Triton upon its purchase of our Common Stock under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 11, 2020 between the Company and Triton. The Company will also receive up to 1,000,000 from Triton upon its exercise of warrants pursuant to that certain Common Stock Purchase Warrant dated December 11, 2020 between the Company and Triton. This registration statement was filed to comply with the terms of our transaction with Triton, under which Triton agreed to invest up to 2 Million in our Company, said Jason Remillard, President and founder of Data443. With the effectiveness of the registration statement, we can now receive proceeds from the investment by Triton, in the discretion of the Company.

This investment by Triton represents a major inflection point in our growth and continued progress toward uplisting to a higher exchange. While we are grateful to our prior convertible note investors for their support and confidence, this Triton investment is a true equity deal, reflective of our maturity as a company and investment opportunity.
