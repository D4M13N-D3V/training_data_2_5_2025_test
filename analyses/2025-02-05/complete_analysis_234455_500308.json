July 26, 2016 CYREN teamed with Osterman Research to ask questions of IT and security professionals at over 300 small and medium-sized businesses during June, and the resulting report is available for download here , and discussed in last weeks webinar available here . There are a lot of surveys and reports and white papers circulating which are focused on security issues at large enterprises, but the amount of information available on the security posture, problems and priorities of Mid-Market or SMBs is noticeably thin. Formerly entitled IT Security at SMBs CYREN 2016 Benchmarking Survey, the survey report is brimming with data and insights and answers questions like What percentage of SMBs suffered an infection or security breach in the past year, and how much did it cost them? How fast are IT security-related budgets rising at small and mid-size companies? What security solutions have such companies deployed, and from which vendors? How are companies protecting traveling employees? The responses to these and other questions are a great opportunity for any IT or security professional at a mid-market to benchmark themselves against their peers. Some survey highlights include 71 of SMBs have suffered an infection or breach in the past 12 months. The most prevalent type of breach was phishing-related, suffered by 43 of the companies surveyed. IT security-related costs are exploding, with an increase of 23 in the past year. 29 of SMBs already subscribe to some type of SaaS web security protection. 56 of SMBs say they are now doing SSL traffic inspection.

      "user_guidance": "### Security Guidance for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses (SMBs)\n\nBased on the findings from the CYREN and Osterman Research survey, it\u2019s clear that SMBs face significant security challenges. Here are some practical, easy-to-follow security recommendations to help protect your organization:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Security Best Practices**\n- **Train Employees Regularly:**  \n  Conduct regular security awareness training to educate employees on phishing, social engineering, and other common threats. Phishing was the most prevalent breach type in the survey, so this is critical.\n- **Keep Software Updated:**  \n  Ensure all operating systems, applications, and security tools are up-to-date with the latest patches to protect against vulnerabilities.\n- **Use Strong Passwords:**  \n  Implement a password policy that requires strong, unique passwords for all accounts. Consider using a password manager to securely store credentials.\n- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  \n  MFA adds an extra layer of security for account logins, making it much harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Back Up Data Regularly:**  \n  Perform regular backups of critical data and store them securely, both on-premises and in the cloud. Test backups periodically to ensure they can be restored.\n- **Use Encryption:**  \n  Encrypt sensitive data both at rest (stored) and in transit (being sent over networks) to prevent unauthorized access.\n- **Implement Access Controls:**  \n  Restrict access to sensitive data and systems based on the principle of least privilege (only grant access to those who need it).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Avoid Untrusted Links and Attachments:**  \n  Educate employees to never click on suspicious links or open attachments from unknown sources, as these are common phishing tactics.\n- **Secure Wi-Fi Networks:**  \n  Use strong encryption (e.g., WPA3) for Wi-Fi networks, and avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions.\n- **Use Antivirus and Anti-Malware Tools:**  \n  Install and regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software to detect and block malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Phishing Attacks:**  \n  Train employees to recognize phishing attempts, and implement email filtering tools to block malicious emails.\n- **Ransomware:**  \n  Regularly back up data, keep systems updated, and use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to detect and block ransomware.\n- **Insider Threats:**  \n  Monitor user activity for unusual behavior, and enforce strict access controls to prevent data theft or accidental damage.\n- **Unpatched Vulnerabilities:**  \n  Prioritize patch management to fix vulnerabilities quickly, as unpatched systems are a leading cause of breaches.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Data Minimization:**  \n  Only collect and store the data necessary for your business operations to reduce the risk of data breaches.\n- **Secure Sensitive Information:**  \n  Use encryption and access controls to protect sensitive customer and employee data.\n- **Comply with Regulations:**  \n  Familiarize yourself with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and ensure your organization complies with them.\n\n---\n\n### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- **If You Experience a Breach:**  \n  Immediately contact a cybersecurity professional to investigate and contain the breach, and notify affected parties as required by law.\n- **If You Lack Expertise:**  \n  SMBs often lack dedicated security teams. Consider outsourcing security operations to a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP).\n- **During Rapid Growth:**  \n  As your business grows, your security needs become more complex. Seek expert advice to scale your security posture appropriately.\n- **For Complex Threats:**  \n  Advanced persistent threats (APTs) or sophisticated attacks may require specialized tools and expertise to combat effectively.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nsecurity is a shared responsibility that requires ongoing effort and awareness. By following these guidelines, SMBs can significantly reduce their risk of breaches and better protect their data and systems. Stay vigilant, keep educating your team, and be prepared to adapt to evolving threats.\n\nLet me know if you have further questions or need more specific guidance!"
