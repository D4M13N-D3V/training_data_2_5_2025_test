In 2018, the underground phishing economy has come of age, with the evolution of phishing kits offering spoofed web pages  basic equipment for any phishing attack  a prime example. Phishing-as-a-Service as a broader phenomenon has ushered in a new era of sophistication and access for the low-level cybercriminal  democratizing phishing attacks.

The top five phishing kits highlighted below are notable because they are high in volume, highly targeted and highly sophisticated  a trifecta that is emboldening low-level criminals to take on some of the biggest brandsand enterprises. 1  Multi-brand Microsoft Office 365 Phishing Kit The most-used phishing kit targets Microsoft Office 365 and Outlook credentials. While consumer brands still get the most overall phishing activity, its clear that the phishing-as-a-service market is meeting demand to penetrate enterprises, with the goal of finding deeper pockets. This kit was found in use most frequently with spoofed Office 365 login pages, but it is a multi-brand kitit also provides spoofed pages for AOL, Bank of America, Chase, Daum, DHL, Dropbox, Facebook, Gmail, Skype, USAA, Webmail, Wells Fargo, and Yahoo. 2  Microsoft Office 365 Phishing Kit This kit is specific to Office 365 phishing, and includes built-in techniques to evade detection, including blocking IPs and security bots and user agents to hide from standard phishing defenses. 3  PayPal Phishing Kit Unlike cheap and phony PayPal emails from yesteryear, this phishing kit employs new levels of sophistication, with several evasive techniques.

Security Features and Capabilities:**\n\n- **Multi-Brand Targeting:** Phishing kits can spoof multiple brands, making them versatile for attackers. This means security solutions must be equally versatile, capable of detecting a wide range of threats.\n- **Evasion Techniques:** Advanced kits use methods to avoid detection, such as blocking specific IPs and masking as legitimate traffic. Security systems need robust detection mechanisms to uncover these evasive tactics.\n- **Platform-Specific Attacks:** Kits like those targeting Office 365 focus on enterprise credentials, necessitating strong protection for corporate accounts and data.\n- **Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS):** These kits are user-friendly for attackers, so security solutions must be easy to deploy and manage, even for organizations with limited expertise.\n\n**2. User Benefits and Protection Measures:**\n\n- **Threat Detection:** Solutions should include email filtering and phishing detection to block malicious attempts before they reach users.\n- **Vigilance Training:** Regular security awareness programs help users recognize and avoid phishing attempts.\n- **Credential Protection:** Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain access.\n- **Incident Response:** Having a plan in place ensures quick action if a breach occurs, minimizing potential damage.\n\n**3. Integration with Existing Security Systems:**\n\n- **Advanced Threat Detection:** Integrate AI or machine learning into email systems to detect sophisticated phishing patterns.\n- **SIEM Integration:** Incorporate with Security Information and Event Management systems for comprehensive monitoring and response.\n- **Ecosystem Approach:** Ensure security solutions work seamlessly with existing tools, enhancing overall protection without disrupting workflows.\n\n**4. Compliance and Certification Details:**\n\n- **Regulatory Compliance:** Adhere to GDPR, HIPAA, etc., through mandated security measures and regular audits.\n- **Certifications:** Obtain certifications like ISO 27001 to ensure robust security controls are in place.\n- **Training Requirements:** Conduct frequent phishing awareness training to meet compliance standards and reduce risks.\n\n**5. Security Best Practices for Users:**\n\n- **Source Verification:** Always verify the sender\u2019s identity before interacting with emails or links.\n- **MFA Use:** Enable MFA to protect accounts from unauthorized access.\n- **Software Updates:** Regularly update security solutions to guard against the latest threats.\n- **Behavior Monitoring:** Use tools to monitor user behavior for potential breaches.\n\n**6.
