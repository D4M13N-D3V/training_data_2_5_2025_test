Internal communication and client exchanges are saved somewhere in the mass of personal content and overlooked messages. Businesses need to be prepared with a strategy for archiving and locating information within e-mail platforms, quickly and efficiently, to enable data compliance and business continuity. Challenge Companys cost for data storage is too high, A study by the Compliance, Governance and Oversight Council offered that nearly 69 of the data stored has no value to the company. By that math, the amount companies are spending on data storage could be exponentially higher than needed. Unfortunately, without a process to identify and classify data, data duplicates are often stored in multiple locations, without structure, increasing storage cost and discovery difficulty. ArcMail reduces storage costs by using custom retention policies based on content, ensuring accurate and compliant copies of all data and communications are retained for the entire period required for each unique piece of data, while non-valuable data and data duplicates do not occupy storage space. Challenge Organization needs a way to simplify eDiscovery and Compliance With 60 of essential data, often including sensitive content, being exchanged and stored through e-mail, when organizations need to locate specific content for legal purposes or to demonstrate regulatory compliance, they need a way to quickly and easily locate and find the data they search for. An e-mail archiving solution, like ArcMail , enables organizations to reduce overall legal risk and to meet regulatory compliance. With both granular retention and intuitive search policies, users are able to find and access the information they need quickly, within time constraints, simplifying the discovery process and ensuring compliance. Challenge Cloud Based Solution that enables Compliance Many companies employee some version of a backup system within the organization thinking they are covered for compliance and data loss, not understanding the need for a secure archiving platform. Unlike backups, ArcMail acts your companies data vault. Each and every piece of data that goes in can no longer be modified, edited or deleted. Data is archived in transit, preventing users from deliberately or accidentally removing content from the archive. When it comes to cloud enablement, an archiving solution that gives businesses unlimited storage in a secure environment with controlled access is a must. ArcMail allows users to leverage cost-effective and scalable storage, while maintaining utmost security and quick searches. Some highly regulated organizations hope to use cloud technologies, but fear they cannot do so without some form of on-sight appliance. Hybrid on-premisecloud based solutions, like that offered by ArcMail, gives customers the best of both worlds, creating a peace of mind cloud efficiency and data archive scalability, with the protection from network or power outage complications and non-authorized end-user access concerns through the appliance. Whether your organization is legally bound by regulation, in need of a simple eDiscovery solution, looking for a data storage cost-reduction or wants to promote business continuity, a complete archiving solution is the answer you need. When looking for that solution, focus on those that provide an easy to use platform, feature granular customizable retention to optimize storage, support migration from legacy systems, and provide reports for audits, compliance and discovery.

    "content": "**Analysis of ArcMail's Email Archiving Solution**\n\n**1. Key Security Features and Benefits:**\n   - **Immutability:** ArcMail acts as a data vault, ensuring data cannot be modified or deleted once archived. This feature is crucial for maintaining data integrity and compliance.\n   - **Custom Retention Policies:** These policies help reduce storage costs and minimize the attack surface by retaining only necessary data for required periods.\n   - **Hybrid Deployment Model:** Offers flexibility and security, ensuring data availability during outages and protecting against unauthorized access through on-site appliances.\n\n**2. Compliance Certifications and Regulatory Adherence:**\n   - **HIPAA Compliance:** Specifically mentioned, making it suitable for healthcare industries. However, other certifications like ISO 27001, SOC 2, or GDPR are not mentioned, which are important for broader compliance needs.\n\n**3. User-Focused Security Recommendations:**\n   - **Training and Education:** Users should be trained on effective use of the system, understanding retention policies, and conducting searches.\n   - **Best Practices:** Regular audits, monitoring access logs, and careful configuration of retention policies are essential for security and compliance.\n\n**4. Technical Security Implementation Details:**\n   - **Immutability and Controlled Access:** While mentioned, specifics on encryption (at rest or in transit) and authentication methods (e.g., MFA, RBAC) are lacking, which are crucial for data protection.\n   - **Redundancy and Availability:** The hybrid model provides redundancy, enhancing business continuity, but details on encryption standards and secure authentication are needed.\n\n**5. Data Protection Measures:**\n   - **Immutability and Integrity:** Ensures data integrity, a key component of security.\n   - **Encryption and Access Control:** The analysis notes gaps in detailed encryption methods and specific access controls, which are vital for thorough data protection.\n\n**6. Best Practices for End Users:**\n   - Emphasize regular security audits, monitoring, and user training to enhance overall security posture.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nArcMail's solution excels in cost reduction, compliance, and eDiscovery, with strong features like immutability and a hybrid deployment model. However, to fully assess its security robustness, more details on encryption, compliance certifications beyond HIPAA, and specific access controls are needed. A balanced approach recognizing both strengths and areas for improvement provides a comprehensive security overview.",
