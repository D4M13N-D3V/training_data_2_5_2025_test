There are reports of disruption at the likes of British National Health Service medical centers, German Railway ticket computers, FedEx and Telefonica, which apparently ordered employees to disconnect their computers from the corporate network in an attempt to stymie the spread of the ransomware . WannaCrypt encrypts files found on the system and initially demands ransom payment of 300 in Bitcoin to specific addresses, with the payment demand amount reportedly escalating over time. Global map showing WannaCrypt infections on Day 1 How Its Spreading Of particular note is how WannaCrypt is spreading. Unlike most ransomware, which is delivered via email, WannaCrypt has worm-like capabilities, and will infect any open remote desktop session specifically using Microsofts Remote Desktop Protocol on the infected machine using a known NSA exploit called ETERNALBLUE, which was leaked by the hacking group The Shadow Brokers on April 14. The ETERNALBLUE exploit is used to spread the WannaCrypt ransomware leveraging a Windows SMBv1 protocol vulnerability that was patched by Microsoft in March  but evidently many, many governmental institutions, businesses and individuals have yet to install the patch. How WannaCrypt Works After a system has been infected with the WannaCrypt ransomware, the installer will extract an embedded resource in the same folder that is a password protected zip file wcry.zip. The zip file contains files that the ransomware uses and executes. WannaCrypt will also download a TOR client to communicate with the WannaCrypt C2 servers gx7ekbenv2riucmf.onion cwwnhwhlz52maqm7.onion 76jdd2ir2embyv47.onion 57g7spgrzlojinas.onion xxlvbrloxvriy2c5.onion What Files are Encrypted WannaCrypt will encrypt files with the following extension .der, .pfx, .key, .crt, .csr, .p12, .pem, .odt, .sxw, .stw, .3ds, .max, .3dm, .ods, .sxc, .stc, .dif, .slk, .wb2, .odp, .sxd, .std, .sxm, .sqlite3, .sqlitedb, .sql, .accdb, .mdb, .dbf, .odb, .mdf, .ldf, .cpp, .pas, .asm, .cmd, .bat, .vbs, .sch, .jsp, .php, .asp, .java, .jar, .class, .mp3, .wav, .swf, .fla, .wmv, .mpg, .vob, .mpeg, .asf, .avi, .mov, .mp4, .mkv, .flv, .wma, .mid, .m3u, .m4u, .svg, .psd, .tiff, .tif, .raw, .gif, .png, .bmp, .jpg, .jpeg, .iso, .backup, .zip, .rar, .tgz, .tar, .bak, .ARC, .vmdk, .vdi, .sldm, .sldx, .sti, .sxi, .dwg, .pdf, .wk1, .wks, .rtf, .csv, .txt, .msg, .pst, .ppsx, .ppsm, .pps, .pot, .pptm, .pptx, .ppt, .xltm, .xltx, .xlc, .xlm, .xlt, .xlw, .xlsb, .xlsm, .xlsx, .xls, .dotm, .dot, .docm, .docx, .doc The new extension will be .WNCRY after a file has been encrypted, and WannaCrypt will leave a Please_read_me.txt file and WanaDecryptor.exe in every folder where files have been encrypted.
