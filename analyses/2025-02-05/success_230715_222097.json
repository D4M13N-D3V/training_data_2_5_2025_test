Much of my interest has been towards how to provide more authenticity to transactions and secure the history of contentdata  to a forensic level if required for certain types of data and who doesnt want to be 100 sure of data? Todays security tech largely sits out on an island on its own  usually only contextually focused on its specific use cases and not playing well with others.
