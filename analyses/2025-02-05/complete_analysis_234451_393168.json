The ability to share data freely is becoming a key driver of competitive advantage. For many organizations, however, the requirement to share and collaborate is outweighed by very real security concerns. Traditional IAM solutions use identity as the root of trust, but identity, as provisioned by a single entity, is insufficient for sharing sensitive resources with complex policies attached to them Identity Access Management IAM, the traditional safeguard of internal sharing and collaboration, does not address the need for organizations to extend their reach by connecting with external parties. Equipped only with tools that let them manage provisioned identities, IT cannot safeguard external access requests. To confidently share information, organizations need more real-time information, authentication and authorization options to make smart access decisions. Traditional IAM solutions use identity as the root of trust, but identity, as provisioned by a single entity, is insufficient for sharing sensitive resources with complex policies attached to them, said Ethan Ayer, CEO of Resilient Network Systems , the contextual access control company. Our solution gives customers a convenient way to gather enough context to answer more sophisticated questions like Is this a doctor? or Is this a trusted device? Enough data is already out there to separate good actors from the bad, thus eliminating most fraud and theft. It is our job as a community to connect and organize that data to manifest a more secure and private online future. Resilient Network Systems contextual access solution, Resilient Access, orchestrates all the necessary information so that organizations can be confident that they are granting appropriate access. Unique network-based architecture allows the system to query distributed authoritative sources to understand and resolve the subject, resource, action and environmental attributes that make up a typical access request. In addition to traditional features like single-sign-on and multi-factor authentication, a flexible policy workflow engine enables organizations to quickly and easily safeguard apps, data, documents and files with their own custom access rules. The result of years of advanced research and development, Resilient Access is being used in both the public and private sectors. In addition to CEO Ethan Ayer, a former Partner at One Equity Partners  Milestone Venture Partners, the leadership team is comprised of Chairman Richard Spires, ex-CIO of the Department of Homeland Security, EVP Development Rob Gingell, ex-Chief Engineer of Sun Microsystems and Sun Fellow and Consulting Engineer Mark Hapner, J2EE Lead Architect and ex-Sun Distinguished Engineer.

      "user_guidance": "### End-User Guidance on Data Security and Protection\n\nTo help you protect your data and maintain security, especially in the context of sharing and collaborating both internally and externally, we\u2019ve outlined some practical and easy-to-follow guidance below.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Security Best Practices**\n- **Use Strong, Unique Passwords:**  \n  Avoid using the same password across multiple accounts. Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.\n  \n- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  \n  Whenever possible, enable MFA for an additional layer of security. This ensures that even if your password is compromised, your account remains secure.\n  \n- **Keep Devices and Software Updated:**  \n  Regularly update your operating system, applications, and browser to patch security vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Be Mindful of External Sharing:**  \n  Before sharing sensitive data with external parties, ensure you understand the recipient's access rights and permissions.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Classify Your Data:**  \n  Understand the sensitivity of the data you are handling. Use tools like Instant Data Classification to label files appropriately (e.g., \"Confidential\" or \"Public\").\n  \n- **Use Encryption:**  \n  Encrypt sensitive files and communications, especially when sharing externally. Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be read without the decryption key.\n  \n- **Back Up Your Data:**  \n  Regularly back up important files to a secure, encrypted storage solution. This protects against accidental deletion or ransomware attacks.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Avoid Unsafe Networks:**  \n  Avoid accessing sensitive data or systems over public Wi-Fi or unsecured networks. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) if you must connect to public networks.\n  \n- **Verify Identities Before Sharing:**  \n  Confirm the identity of external collaborators before sharing sensitive data. Use tools like Resilient Access to verify attributes such as \"Is this a trusted device?\" or \"Is this user authorized?\"\n  \n- **Monitor Access Logs:**  \n  Periodically review who has accessed your data and ensure access rights are up to date. Remove access for users who no longer need it.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Phishing Attacks:**  \n  Be cautious of unsolicited emails, links, or attachments, especially those asking for login credentials or sensitive information. Verify the sender\u2019s identity before responding.\n  \n- **Weak Access Controls:**  \n  Implement the principle of least privilege\u2014only grant the minimum level of access necessary for users to perform their tasks.\n  \n- **Data Leaks:**  \n  Avoid oversharing or storing sensitive data in unapproved cloud services or personal devices.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Minimize Data Sharing:**  \n  Only share data that is absolutely necessary for collaboration. Remove unnecessary personal or sensitive information before sharing.\n  \n- **Use Privacy Tools:**  \n  Utilize tools like Privacy Management Services to ensure compliance with data protection regulations and maintain user privacy.\n  \n- **Encrypt Personal Information:**  \n  Always encrypt personal or sensitive data, especially when sharing it externally.\n\n---\n\n### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- **Suspect a Security Incident:**  \n  If you notice unusual account activity, receive a suspicious email, or believe your data has been compromised, report it immediately to your IT or security team.\n  \n- **Unclear About Permissions:**  \n  If you\u2019re unsure whether to share data or grant access to someone, consult your security policy or seek guidance from your IT department.\n  \n- **Handling Sensitive Data:**  \n  When working with highly sensitive or regulated data (e.g., healthcare records, financial information), always use approved tools and consult with your organization\u2019s security team.\n\n---\n\nBy following these practical steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and ensure secure collaboration, both internally and externally. Remember, security is a shared responsibility, and your vigilance plays a critical role in protecting your organization\u2019s assets."
