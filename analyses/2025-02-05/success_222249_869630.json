Security Best Practices\n- **Use Strong Passwords**: Implement passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining letters, numbers, and symbols. Use a password manager to securely store them.\n- **Regular Software Updates**: Keep all devices and software updated to protect against known vulnerabilities.\n- **Data Backups**: Regularly back up important data to a secure, encrypted location, such as an external drive or cloud storage.\n\n#### 2. Data Protection Recommendations\n- **Encryption**: Use encryption for sensitive data both at rest and in transit to ensure it remains unreadable to unauthorized parties.\n- **Access Controls**: Limit data access to only those who need it, using role-based permissions to minimize exposure.\n\n#### 3. Safe Usage Guidelines\n- **Avoid Suspicious Links/Attachments**: Be cautious with emails or links from unknown sources. Hover over links to check their destination before clicking.\n- **Use VPNs**: When using public Wi-Fi, employ a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic and protect your data.\n\n#### 4.
