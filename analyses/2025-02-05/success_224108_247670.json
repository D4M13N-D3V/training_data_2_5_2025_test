Many governments around the world are moving their tax-filing deadlines and lifting late penalties to help their citizens cope up with the situation. In Canada for example, the tax-filing deadline has been moved from April 30, 2020 to June 1, 2020 and also giving a penalty-free extension to Canadian taxpayers, including businesses, until August 31, 2020 to pay for taxes owed. This move from the government appears to have gained phishing interests leading to a reactivation of an old phishing kit, which targets taxpayers who are expecting refunds from tax returns. An Old Phish Kit We recently came across a zip archive that was named covid.zip uploaded to a malicious site, which upon taking a closer look contains phishing pages targeted to taxpayers wanting to deposit their tax refunds to affiliate banks in Canada. This particular phish kit is known to have existed since 2018, but even though it is old, it still poses a threat to the users of the affiliated banks. Figure 1.0 The covid.zip package contents hxxpsamelzendez.comcovid.zip  869e7dc7c2897e13385d6a26f348858b9f83321702eba383bd3381b7cd3d485e The index.htm component leads to a welcome page with an option to choose either English or French version, both options lead to a selection of associated Canadian banks where users can supposedly deposit money from their tax refunds. Figure 2.0 Phishing Welcome Page Figure 2.1 Affiliated banks selection page Most of the phishing pages attempt to steal bank account details from taxpayers by luring them into updating their bank account profiles or personal information. Figure 3.0 National Bank Phishing Page  Banking Profile Update Page In one of the phishing pages, disguised as Alberta Treasury Branches ATB online banking page, personally identifiable information PII stolen by asking victims to confirm their personal information including their Social Insurance and Drivers License numbers. A clear phishing indicator, however, should raise users suspicion that they are not on a legitimate online banking site when bank card information such as the CVV2 and ATM PIN as asked for, as also seen from the ATB phishing page. Figure 4.0 Alberta Treasury Branches Phishing Page  Personal Information Update Page and Card Information Most of the target bank websites are mirrored with a third-party tool and stolen information are sent to an email address, which is set in a configuration file for each targeted bank. Figure 5.0 Configuration File We highly recommend people to be very mindful of clicking links in emails and text messages and always check if the online banking websites they are visiting are legitimate by inspecting site security information on their browsers. It is also very important to keep your personal information safe at all times by knowing which information you only need to and can provide online.
