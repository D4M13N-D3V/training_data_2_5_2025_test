Security Best Practices**\n- **Be Cautious with Emails**: Avoid opening unsolicited emails, especially those with attachments or links from unknown senders. Phishing emails often mimic trusted services like DocuSign.\n- **Verify Senders**: Check the sender's email address for legitimacy. Hover over links to preview URLs before clicking.\n- **Avoid Suspicious Attachments**: Do not open attachments like ZIP files from unknown sources, as they may contain malware.\n\n**2. Data Protection Measures**\n- **Back Up Regularly**: Schedule regular data backups, both on external devices and in secure cloud storage.\n- **Use Encryption**: Protect sensitive files with encryption. Use secure platforms for sharing personal information.\n- **Access Controls**: Limit data access to necessary personnel and use strong passwords.\n\n**3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Antivirus Software**: Install and regularly update antivirus software to detect and block threats.\n- **System Updates**: Keep operating systems, browsers, and software updated to patch vulnerabilities.\n- **Safe Browsing**: Avoid suspicious websites and use a reputable ad-blocker to reduce infection risks.\n\n**4.
