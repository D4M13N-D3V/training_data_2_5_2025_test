Join me here every few weeks where Ill share my observations on the latest technology happenings within the Beltway and across Government. Well discuss the latest trends in Identity and Access Management, as well as some of the conferences and meetings I attend in my role as VP of Business Development and Sales at Resilient Network Systems. Recently, I attended a fascinating demonstration of contextual access control technology for first responders in Brooklyn, New York. On January 24-26, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security DHS Science and Technology Directorate ST held the Urban Operations Experimentation OpEx technology demonstration event at the New York City Emergency Management Center NYCEM . The DHS STs National Urban Security Technology Laboratory NUSTL ran the event. NUSTL is a federal laboratory organized within the DHS STs First Responders Group that provides products and services to help first responders prepare, protect and respond to homeland security threats. The NUSTL OpEx event brought together a series of commercial technology vendors who had submitted proposals the previous year to have their technologies reviewed by first responders in New York. The winning vendors represented various capabilities that met specific first responder challenge areas identified by DHS. Resilient Network Systems RNS teamed with Haystax and Honeycomb Networks to demonstrate a real-time threat intelligence evaluation, prioritization and automated routing capability that included policy-driven contextual access control of the system users and data, and which could deliver new EDXL data feeds for use. After Honeycomb reviewed EDXL protocol information, Haystaxs Constellation analytics platform walked through a mock scenario where the NYCEM had to manage a visiting dignitary in New York whose carefully scheduled agenda is interrupted by unplanned demonstrations, traffic problems, policefire activities, and foul weather that culminates in a tornado event. As the scenario progressed, additional resources were needed onsite in various areas to report and respond to the shifting situation. Some of these resources were purpose-dispatched from the NYCEM and various first responder offices, while others were already in the field on other duties, and still others who were not on duty at all. RNSs Resilient Access system demonstrated how all of these users could be quickly provisioned into Constellation via their mobile devices, with each going through a unique policy-directed authentication workflow that delivered specific individualized access rights to each user. This enabled each user to receive the specific data, and access the specific systems they needed to perform the role assigned by the NYCEM, while still allowing the NYCEM to maintain the security and control critical for the success of their emergency management mission. After presenting to the first responders at the OpEx event for the two planned hours, a QA session between the first responders and Resilient, Haystax and Honeycomb continued for another hour and a half. To DHSs satisfaction, the first responders walked away with a greater understanding of EDXL Emergency Data Exchange Language as a viable protocol for their use, of Constellation as a real-time threat intelligence core capability, and if the numbertypes of questions were any indication, with a new understanding and appreciation of just how powerful policy-driven contextual access control can be in support of their core missions. About the author Daemon Price is the VP of Business Development and Sales at Resilient Networks Systems. A Virginia Tech graduate, where he participated in the Corps of Cadets, Daemon held multiple postings within the Dept. of Agriculture and the Dept. of Commerce before taking his information security experience to the private sector where he worked for both small businesses like SoftMed Systems creator of the original electronic health record and Blackboard education IT innovator to prime contractors like CSC, SAIC and 3M. With government awards and billion dollar solicitation wins to his credit, Daemon continues as a passionate technology evangelist and can be seen often at events held by AFCEA, INSA, NDIA, AUSA, FCW and many others. By identity, we mean a specific set of attributes that, when paired with the right context, and policy evaluation engine, allows the user to connect and access only the company data and apps that they are supposed to have access to.

    "content": "### Security Recommendations Based on Contextual Access Control Demonstration\n\n1. **Security Best Practices:**\n   - **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Ensure access is granted based on user roles and responsibilities, aligning with the principles demonstrated in the DHS event.\n   - **Adopt Standardized Data Protocols:** Use protocols like EDXL to facilitate seamless data exchange and improve interoperability across systems.\n\n2. **Data Protection Strategies:**\n   - **Integrate Real-Time Threat Intelligence:** Incorporate threat feeds to dynamically adjust access controls and enhance security posture.\n   - **Employ Dynamic Access Control:** Use contextual factors like user location and time to limit data access, preventing potential breaches.\n\n3. **Safe Usage Guidelines:**\n   - **Educate Users on Contextual Access:** Train users to understand and navigate dynamic access controls, ensuring they know why certain accesses are granted or denied.\n   - **Regularly Update Policies:** Adjust access policies as user roles and operational scenarios change to maintain relevance and security.\n\n4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention:**\n   - **Mitigate Over-Privilege Risks:** Regularly review and update access controls to prevent unnecessary permissions that could lead to breaches.\n   - **Monitor for Insider Threats:** Use contextual access controls and monitoring to detect and prevent potential internal security incidents.\n\n5. **Privacy Protection Measures:**\n   - **Practice Data Minimization:** Ensure users only access necessary data, reducing exposure of sensitive information.\n   - **Conduct Regular Audits:** Perform audits to identify and address unauthorized access, safeguarding individual privacy.\n\n6. **When to Seek Additional Support:**\n   - **Consult Experts for Critical Systems:** Engage security professionals when dealing with critical infrastructure or highly sensitive data.\n   - **Seek Help During Incidents:** Contact specialists immediately in the event of a security breach to effectively contain and investigate.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBalancing security with usability is crucial, as seen in the DHS demonstration. By implementing contextual access controls, real-time threat intelligence, and regular policy updates, organizations can enhance security while maintaining operational efficiency. Emphasize adaptability and user education to foster a secure and productive environment.",
