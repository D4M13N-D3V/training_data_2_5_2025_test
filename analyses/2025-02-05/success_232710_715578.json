As weve discussed before  this legislation has world wide implications and I feel and have validated with many other experts that this will probably be more intense and business changing than Sarbanes Oxley was  especially if you consider the world wide impacts. We have made moves in this area  ClassiDocs being the first. We are stocking powder, product and people as the deadline looms and organizations begin to operate in this new arena.

To be sure  there is no question about the motivation  Information Protection for everyone, Transparency on its uses, and proper stewardship of Data. It is Olympic time  and for me  that means Hockey! Although I wont disclose who I am rooting for, my favorite number was up on the site today 99  and as the Great One says Skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been .
