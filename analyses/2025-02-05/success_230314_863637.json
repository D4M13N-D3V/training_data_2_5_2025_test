Take for example the cybercriminals who stole client contact information from a DC-area real estate company, and then created a business email compromise BEC scam , which resulted in 1.5 million being stolen in a phishingwire fraud scheme from a couple about to close on a home. The increase in these types of real estate-focused threats is not merely anecdotal. In 2017, the FBI warned of the dramatic increase in cyberattacks specifically targeting real estate companies. According to the agency, fraudulent real estate transactions as a result of cybercrime increased from 19 million in 2016 to almost 1 billion US 969M in 2017. The number of inbound complaints to the FBI on the topic of cyber attacks against real estate companies also grew between 2016 and 2017 by 480 Criminals are after two thingsinformation andmoney not necessarily in that order The type of attack most commonly targeted at real companies is phishing, typically business email compromise BEC or imposter email attacks. These types of phishing attacks can take several forms. In the simplest rendition, the hacker may be after internal corporate data. So, they will send an email pretending to be someone that the recipient knows, such as a trusted partner or vendor, or even someone that works at the same real estate company. The perpetrator may request user names and passwords to corporate networks, a list of employee W2s or email addresses, the names and email addresses for current clients, or even proprietary data, such as competitive market research. Often this type of information can be sold on the black market or used as a starting point for additional phishing attacks When money is at stake, particularly the large sums often seen during real estate transactions, hackers turn to more insidious criminal tactics. If the criminal has obtained the user name and password for the real estate agents email through an earlier phishing or malware attack, they may engage in a BEC scam, whereby they send an email directly from the agents account to a current customer about to close on a property. Pretending to be the agent, the criminal provides closing instructions, including fraudulent wire transfer details. The customer, not suspecting anything, transmits the money to the criminals account. Unfortunately, in many instance these large sums of money, often down payments, are lost forever unless the scam is discovered quickly enough to halt the wire transfer. In a similar version, the criminal may pretend to be someone from the settlement company or the sellers agentrepresentative, and send a phishing email directly to the buyers agent. As in the other scenario, this email includes closing instructions, including fraudulent wire transfer details, which the buyers agent may then pass along to the home buyers. That ounce of prevention could be worth a lot Cybercriminals already know that the real estate industry is the primary facilitator for high volume, high dollar figure wire transfers, as well as being the owner of a vast amount of highly sensitive personal information, such as customer names, addresses, emails, social security numbers, and banking data. Couple this with the fact that real estate agents often work in highly dispersed locations, such as their car or a caf\u00e9, using unprotected smart phones to connect to corporate networks, and you have the makings of an almost perfect crime. Thats why advanced cybersecurity protection is so critical. You dont get protection from browsers, email clients, and online freebie security solutions The recent story of the massive Target Corporation breach is one that most people have heard of. What is less well known is that the malicious email at the source of this highly destructive attack came from one of Targets small business partnersan HVAC companyand it probably wouldve been blocked had the HVAC vendor been using an effective email security service, instead of a downloaded freebie security tool that did not include real-time updates to protect its entire system, including access to all the passwords and portals for its various large clients. Free downloadable security tools are designed for individual consumers, and do not offer the type of protection businesses need. Since threats are evolving constantly, real-time security updates are key. Once a threat has been launched, a business only has seconds to block it. If your security tools, or email client such as Gmail or Office 365, or browser arent updated constantlyin real-timethen the protection simply isnt there. Training alone isnt the answer Email threats come in a variety of different shapes and sizes. Some are relatively easy to spot, others are highly curated so they appear entirely legitimatefor example, imposter emails. If a fake email arrives in your accounting department, pretending to be from your CEO with wire transfer directions, how much time do you think your accounting manager is going to take investigating and confirming the authenticity of the email. Chances are, if the email appears to come from the CEO or another high level executive, the target employee will get right on the task and transfer the money. In these instances, training your employees to spot fake or dangerous emails may simply be asking too much. Since operational activities with most real estate companies today take place in the cloud, an automated, systematic approach to security is keyone in which threats are evaluated and blocked in real-time, without relying on the human factor. Be prepared With the operational and transactional components of real estate growing by leaps and bounds in an online cloud environmentand cyberattacks growing at an even faster rateno real estate business wants to be at the center of a data breach that costs a customer their entire life savings and dreams for the future. Real estate businesses need to view cyberattacks as a critical business risk.

Here's a structured approach to enhance your security posture:\n\n### 1. **Security Best Practices**\n\n- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA for all accounts, especially email and financial systems. Use an Authenticator app instead of SMS for added security.\n- **Regular Updates:** Ensure all software, devices, and browsers are updated regularly to protect against vulnerabilities.\n- **Email Filtering:** Implement advanced email filtering solutions to detect and block phishing attempts.\n- **Beware of Urgent Requests:** Be cautious of emails requesting urgent wire transfers. Always verify through a separate communication channel.\n\n### 2. **Data Protection Measures**\n\n- **Encryption:** Use encryption for sensitive client data, both in transit and at rest, to safeguard against unauthorized access.\n- **Backups:** Conduct regular, secure backups and store them offsite or in the cloud to prevent data loss.\n- **Secure Client Communication:** Educate clients on secure communication practices to protect their information.\n\n### 3. **Safe Usage Guidelines**\n\n- **Secure Wi-Fi:** Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions. Opt for a VPN to encrypt internet traffic when working remotely.\n- **Device Security:** Ensure all devices used for business have up-to-date antivirus software and strong passwords.\n- **Phishing Vigilance:** Train employees to recognize phishing attempts, focusing on imposter emails and fake wires.\n\n### 4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n\n- **Phishing Attacks:** Educate employees on spotting fake emails and the importance of verifying requests.\n- **BEC Scams:** Warn clients about fake emails impersonating agents and instruct them to confirm wire details directly.\n- **Malware Risks:** Use reputable antivirus software and avoid downloading suspicious attachments.\n\n### 5. **Privacy Protection Measures**\n\n- **Data Minimization:** Collect only necessary client data and limit access to authorized personnel.\n- **Client Education:** Inform clients about phishing risks and the importance of verifying communication.\n- **Secure Disposal:** Ensure sensitive documents are shredded and digital files are securely deleted.\n\n### 6. **When to Seek Additional Support**\n\n- **Incident Response:** Contact IT or cybersecurity professionals immediately if a breach is suspected.\n- **Security Audits:** Regularly audit systems and processes to identify vulnerabilities.\n- **Training:** Invest in ongoing training for employees, focusing on real-life scenarios common in real estate.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe real estate industry's unique challenges, such as remote work and high-value transactions, necessitate a proactive approach to security. By implementing these practical measures, you can significantly reduce risks, protect client trust, and ensure business continuity. Remember, security is an ongoing process that requires vigilance and adaptability. Stay informed, and empower your team to be your first line of defense against cyber threats.",
