July 19, 2017 Join us for the webinar Identity  Data Governance  5 Steps to Reliable and Accurate Compliance in the Cloud on August 3rd at 2 pm ET  1 pm CT  11 am PT  6pm GMT. Identity and Security Compliance experts will review how Identity and Data can be combined to provide a complete data and access picture in the cloud. Identity without Data Access Permissions is not a viable security solution, and access rights and permissions are meaningless without Data Classification. Also, not enabling your user community to help you perform compliance and certification activities is a recipe in non-compliance. Join this webinar to learn how to implement a combined Data Classification and Governance approach that integrates your Identity Access Management and Governance programs. Cyber security experts Nick Nikols, Principal Consultant TechVision Research and former Vice President of Product at Computer Associates, Jason Remillard, President, IP Risk Control and Founder of ClassiDocs, and Jay ODonnell, President, N8 Identity and Founder of TheAccessHub will discuss  Industry problems and approaches  Cloud and on-prem scenario reviews  Data Classification and Governance coupled with Identity Compliance, Governance and Certification  The role of AI and Machine Learning  How you can start a project in 30-minutes DATE  TIME August 3 at 2 pm ET  1 pm CT  11 am PT  6pm GMT Register Here  If you cant make it to the live webinar, please register and we will make an on-demand version of the event available to you.

    "content": "### Security Guidance Based on Webinar Content\n\n1. **Security Best Practices:**\n   - **Integrate Identity and Data Governance:** Combine your Identity Access Management (IAM) with Data Governance to ensure a comprehensive view of data and access, enhancing your cloud security posture.\n   - **Centralized Identity Management:** Use IAM solutions to centralize identity and access management, simplifying the enforcement of access policies.\n   - **Leverage AI and Machine Learning:** Explore the use of AI and ML to automate data classification and threat detection, improving efficiency and accuracy.\n   - **Quick Project Start:** Initiate a project in 30 minutes by focusing on high-impact tasks such as basic data classification or initial IAM setup.\n\n2. **Data Protection Recommendations:**\n   - **Least Privilege Principle:** Limit access rights to what is necessary, reducing the risk of data breaches from insider threats or compromised accounts.\n   - **Encrypt Sensitive Data:** Use encryption for PII and sensitive data both in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorized access.\n   - **Regular Backups and Audits:** Schedule regular backups and conduct audits to ensure data integrity and compliance with regulations.\n\n3. **Safe Usage Guidelines:**\n   - **User Training:** Educate users on security best practices, data handling, and recognizing phishing attempts to empower them in security efforts.\n   - **Secure Browsing:** Advise against accessing sensitive data from public Wi-Fi and recommend using VPNs for secure connections.\n   - **Avoid Phishing:** Teach users to verify email sources and not click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders.\n\n4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention:**\n   - **Insider Threats:** Monitor user activity for unusual behavior and implement access controls to mitigate risks.\n   - **Phishing Attacks:** Conduct regular phishing simulations and training to improve user awareness.\n   - **Overprivileged Accounts:** Regularly review and update access permissions to ensure they align with current roles and responsibilities.\n\n5. **Privacy Protection Measures:**\n   - **Data Minimization:** Collect only necessary data and anonymize or pseudonymize where possible to reduce privacy risks.\n   - **Encryption Practices:** Apply encryption to sensitive data and ensure secure key management.\n   - **Consent Management:** Implement clear consent mechanisms and transparent privacy policies to comply with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.\n\n6. **When to Seek Additional Support:**\n   - **Feeling Overwhelmed:** If unsure about security practices, consult with cybersecurity professionals.\n   - **Breach Occurrence:** Engage incident response experts immediately if a breach is suspected.\n   - **Specialized Tools:** Seek expert advice when implementing advanced solutions like AI-driven threat detection or data classification tools.\n\nBy following these guidelines, organizations can enhance their security posture, protect sensitive data, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.",
