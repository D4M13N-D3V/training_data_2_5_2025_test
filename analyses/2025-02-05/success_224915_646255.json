Data443 or the Company OTCPK ATDS D , OTCPK ATDS , the leading data security and privacy software company for ALL THINGS DATA SECURITY  , today announced operating results for the year ended December 31, 2021. Recent Business Highlights Secured largest contract in Data443 history with worlds leading multinational financial services corporation for a minimum of 1.54 million over 3\u00bd years with additional spending commitments for Data Placement Manager  Announced a 5.5-year renewal licensing agreement amounting to over 700,000 with Fortune 500 Fintech Member for Data443s Data Placement Manager  Announced the multi-year subscription-based agreement with Emirates NBD Group, a leading banking group in the MENAT region Announced a new 3-year agreement paid up-front with a leading US-based energy provider and its 18 subsidiaries for Data443s Data Identification Manager  Announced a new 3.5-year agreement paid up-front with Puerto Ricos leading financial services organization for Data443s Data Placement Manager  Completed the acquisition of leading Ransomware recovery and Data Extortion Mitigation platform, Centurion SmartShield Appointed Nanuk Warman as Chief Financial Officer Earned the prestigious VB100 Certification from Virus Bulletin for Data443  Antivirus Protection Manager, the Companys first ever antivirus product released in January 2022 Management Commentary Jason Remillard, Data443s founder and Chief Executive Officer, commented, Data443 experienced strong revenue growth in 2021, and we continue to see momentum across each of our product segments as we continue to expand our business development pipeline. We have moved quickly to ramp our capabilities to meet the growing demand for enterprise protection of data across cloud, hybrid cloud, and on-premises. Historically, through the adoption of regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, we have always taken an approach of building out our capabilities to meet the evolving landscape of data privacy and security. Then last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a rule that would impose mandatory reporting for companies around data breaches and other significant cybersecurity incidents within four days. As a Company, we have always understood that data security and privacy legislation would continue driving significant investment by organizations to offset risks from data breaches and damaging information disclosures. In 2021, we continued to manage the business closely. We worked hard to reduce our loss on derivative liabilities by nearly 7 million, or 92 from a year ago, when we reduced our derivative liabilities by over 10 million. At the same time, we managed to close two additional and critically important acquisitions and expanded our marketing footprint to grow awareness of the Data443 product suite. To this day, we are capitalizing on the market opportunities that were experiencing, from the pursuit of new business opportunities to the steady flow of acquisition candidates that we evaluate on a regular basis. While I am encouraged by the strong demand across our business, we will continue to invest in sales and marketing campaigns, with specific product focus on innovation and internal talent development. We look forward to continued success in 2022 as we continue to focus on revenue growth, expanding customer success, technical innovation, and delivering shareholder value. I am optimistic about our future as we pursue our up-list to a national exchange, and we execute on our plans to deliver superior technology to our customers, concluded Mr. Remillard.
