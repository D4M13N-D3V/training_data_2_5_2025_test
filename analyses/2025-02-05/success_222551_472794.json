From their perch powering 600,000 enterprises cloud inboxes in the United States alone, they report Malware attacks are decreasing. Instead 70 of attacks are through phishing emails, largely to harvest credentials. Attackers are laying long-term traps that scour the internet looking for systems and Internet of Things IoT devices that are vulnerable to ransomware. Cybercriminals are taking advantage of national holidays to attack systems when SecOps resources are thinnest. Related Microsoft Finally Acknowledges COVID-19-Related Cybercrimes In total, 73 of CISOs reported their organizations leaked sensitive data in the last 12 months. Even the savviest targets are struggling to cope with attacks that rapidly morph across sending domains, email addresses, content templates and URL domains. The goal is to increase the combination of variations to remain unseen. The lone bright spot? The number of Covid-themed attacks has fallen sharply since April 2020. Fewer everyday consumers are being targeted but nation-states are increasingly attacking the academic, governmental, and commercial groups involved in vaccine research. Microsoft isnt here to help Perhaps the most troubling part of this report? Microsofts insistence that the problem has to be solved by a community approach. They write Our contribution will only be a small piece of whats needed to address the challenge.
