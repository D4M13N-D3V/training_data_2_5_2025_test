Interestingly, they used many techniques to make the attack more evasive. Related Microsoft reports a leap in attack sophistication The Attack On Thursday, November 26, at 0951 UTC, an immense phishing campaign started targeting more than two thirds of the organizations using Cyren Inbox Security at once. It became one of the biggest malicious attacks in November by the number of phishing emails totally distributed. The emails were sent as if from a Zoom account ,while spoofing the target organizations domain as a sender domain. This made the email look trustworthy, as if it was sent internally inside the enterprise. But once checking the authentication results, the sender mail address was spoofed dkimfail no key for signature dmarcfail failure in both SPF and DKIM compauthfail reason601 marked by Office365 ATP as spoofed. Attackers used the SendGrid infrastructure for emails to reach the maximum number of victims mailboxes sender IP is 168.245.36.62, which is a SendGrid mail server. The email itself contained a message urging the recipient to Review a video conferencing invitation. In order to review invitation the target would click on the phishing URL hxxpsemail.utest.comlsclick?upn under the button. This query opened a fake Microsoft 365 login page hosted on an appspot.comdomain. Example of the phishing landing page hxxpscebxbhilakscgyzdcjdilniduq-dot-chrome-backbone-296016.uc.r. appspot.com ?utm_campaignwebsiteutm_sourcesendgrid.comutm_mediumemail The phishing was distributed by abusing a high-Alexa uTest domain , which redirected to the URL with auto-generated subdomains hosted on another high-Alexa domain appspot.com. Each URL contained sendgrid.com as a UTM source, which attackers could misuse to visualize and measure the impact of the sent emails on the potential victim. This phishing attack combined several techniques abusing the high-Alexa popular domains utest.com and appspot.com leveraging SendGrid infrastructure spoofing the target enterprises domain as mail sender, which made it easier for the phishing emails to by-pass the existing security email filtering capabilities.

      "user_guidance": "### Security Guidance Based on the Phishing Attack Example\n\n#### 1. **Security Best Practices**\n   - **Verify Senders**: Always check the sender's email address. Look for slight misspellings or unusual domains that mimic legitimate ones (e.g., \"microsoft365-security.com\" vs. \"microsoft.com\").\n   - **Be Cautious with Links and Attachments**: Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails, especially those asking for login credentials or sensitive information.\n   - **Hover Before You Click**: Hover over links to preview the URL. If it doesn\u2019t match the context of the email, do not click.\n   - **Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA)**: Enable 2FA/MFA for all accounts, especially email and productivity tools like Microsoft 365 and Zoom.\n\n#### 2. **Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Regular Backups**: Backup critical data regularly. This ensures that even if an attack compromises your files, you can restore them without paying ransoms.\n   - **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use encryption for sensitive data, especially when sending it via email or storing it in cloud services.\n   - **Limit Access to Sensitive Data**: Restrict access to sensitive data to only those who need it. This reduces the risk of accidental or intentional exposure.\n\n#### 3. **Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Question Unsolicited Emails**: If an email seems urgent or suspicious, verify its legitimacy by contacting the sender directly through a phone call or a separate email thread.\n   - **Avoid Using Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Tasks**: Public Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured, making it easier for attackers to intercept your data.\n   - **Beware of Generic Greetings**: Legitimate companies usually address emails to you by name. Be suspicious of emails that use generic salutations like \"Dear Customer.\"\n\n#### 4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Phishing Attacks**: These are the most common type of cyberattack. Be vigilant and recognize the signs, such as urgency, spelling mistakes, and requests for sensitive information.\n   - **Spoofing and Brand Impersonation**: Attackers often impersonate trusted brands like Microsoft, Zoom, or Google. Always verify the authenticity of the email before taking action.\n   - **Malicious URLs**: Attackers use shortened URLs or legitimate-looking domains to redirect you to phishing sites. Use URL-checking tools or services to verify the safety of a link before clicking.\n\n#### 5. **Privacy Protection Measures**\n   - **Limit Personal Information Sharing**: Avoid sharing sensitive personal information (e.g., Social Security numbers, banking details) via email or unsecured platforms.\n   - **Use Privacy Tools**: Consider using privacy-focused tools, such as encrypted email services and VPNs, to protect your online activities.\n   - **Monitor Your Accounts**: Regularly review your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized transactions. Enable alerts for suspicious activity.\n\n#### 6. **When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n   - **Report Suspicious Emails**: If you receive an email that seems suspicious, report it to your IT department or cybersecurity team immediately. Many organizations have dedicated email addresses for reporting phishing attempts.\n   - **Seek Help for Compromised Accounts**: If you suspect your account has been compromised, change your password immediately and contact your organization\u2019s IT support.\n   - **Engage in Security Awareness Training**: Participate in cybersecurity training programs to stay informed about the latest threats and best practices.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing attacks and other cybersecurity threats. Stay vigilant, and always err on the side of caution when interacting with unsolicited emails or links."
