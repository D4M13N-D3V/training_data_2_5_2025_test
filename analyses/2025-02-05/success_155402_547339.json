OTC ATDS, a leading data security and privacy software company, today announced the release of its world leading Data Privacy solution with 30,000 active installations  WordPress GDPR Framework  for compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act the CCPA marketplace. Why it Matters The CCPA  already in effect enforcement commences in July of 2020 Starting in California, Data443 expands its popular offering across the US Adds the Do Not Sell My Information option for quick and easy value for merchants Deploys in minutes Over 100 million WordPress sites in operation in the US alone Coming Up this Year More enhancements lockstep with the GDPR and Global Privacy Manager product set Commercialization options will be built into the platform as adoption continues Powered by industry leading ClassiDocs  Global Privacy Manager integrates natively with the CCPA Framework for WordPress  Extending full Subject Access Reviews SAR for unstructured and structured data content  on premises and in the cloud Leverages latest investments by Data443 of hybrid cloud infrastructure Download Directly From WordPress  Download Privacy Solutions At Data443  Management Commentary Jason Remillard, CEO of Data443, commented, The long planned CCPA Framework plugin for WordPress by Data443 leverages all that is great with our existing, proven and widely used GDPR Framework for WordPress plugin. While much of our competition continues to struggle to attain market traction and uses inflated non externally validated user counts, our active user base is monitored and published by WordPress itself. 30,000 active installations are not easy to create, maintain or keep happy. We work hard daily to keep our users happy and engaged! We hope to grow to the same levels directly in the US-based marketplace as the CCPA, its forecasted changes that are coming up throughout the next 12-18 months, and of course, the myriad different state ones coming for years to come. The current state of the Covid-19 pandemic is more than a unique situation for personal privacy and governance compliance it represents a massive and growing opportunity for Data443 to assume a leading position for data security and privacy. Privacy compliancy enforcement is proceeding in California with no deferrals and other states are proceeding as well. The risks to personal privacy with COVID-19 and return to work activities continue to reinforce the requirements for legislation frameworks and more importantly  simple, fast to deploy and cost-efficient toolsets for business owners to adopt and utilize. We expect these requirements to grow in complexity and volume as 2020 continues, and we continue to deliver solutions to meet these challenges for our clients, added Mr. Remillard.
