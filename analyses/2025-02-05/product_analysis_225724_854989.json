The presence of the EncryptedPackage stream in an OLE2 document indicates that it is protected by a password, which obviously would require the user to enter one in order to open the document properly. Or at least thats what the bad guys would like email or AV scanners to think. Figure 1 Looking at the e-mail, which is couched as a very generic price quote request, the sender did not provide any password for the attachment, so what gives? Figure 2 Sounds like something weve already seen a few years back, six years to be exact. Do you remember VelvetSweatshop and the infamous CVE-2012-0158 exploit which took advantage of the Microsoft Excel default password hidden feature to evade detection? Well, this malware campaign will surely bring you back to those old days. First lets try to open the document to see if Microsoft Office will be able to load it properly. Figure 3 Figure 4 And sure thing, Microsoft Office Excel was able to open the document with no problems at alland no request to enter a password. So lets take a look at whats happening in the background. Exploits Office Vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 The first thing youll notice is the presence of EQNEDT32.EXE being loaded by svchost.exe. This behavior indicates a possible exploitation of CVE-2017-11882 Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability. Figure 5 Digging a little deeper, we debugged the exploit shellcode to see what this document really does in the background. Sure enough, this sample does indeed exploit CVE-2017-11882 and attempts to download and execute an executable payload supposedly saved as PUBLICvbc.exe in the affected computers system, as shown in the screenshots below. Figure 6 Figure 7 VelvetSweatshop Default Password Ploy Still Being Used We also decrypted the email attachment and confirmed that this document is taking advantage of the old Microsoft Office hidden feature that uses a default password to load encrypted documents, as shown in the lines of code in the screenshot below. Figure 8 Unfortunately, the download link from this exploit sample was inaccessible as of this writing, so we are not able to provide an analysis of its payload.

  "analysis": "### Security Analysis and Features Based on the Content\n\n**1. Key Security Features and Capabilities:**\n\n- **Password Evasion Technique:** The document uses a hidden default password feature in Microsoft Office, allowing it to appear protected while opening without a password, bypassing traditional security checks.\n- **Exploitation of CVE-2017-11882:** This vulnerability in Microsoft Office is exploited to execute arbitrary code, potentially downloading and running malicious payloads.\n- **Suspicious Process Behavior:** The loading of EQNEDT32.EXE by svchost.exe indicates malicious activity, suggesting exploit behavior.\n- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** Specific SHA256 hashes and filenames (e.g., PUBLICvbc.exe) help identify and block malicious files and URLs.\n\n**2. User Benefits and Protection Measures:**\n\n- **Detection of Known Vulnerabilities:** Identifies and blocks exploits targeting CVE-2017-11882, preventing malicious code execution.\n- **Email Filtering:** Detects and blocks malicious emails with suspicious attachments, reducing infection risk.\n- **Behavioral Analysis:** Monitors for suspicious processes and quirks, enhancing detection of unknown threats.\n- **Sandboxing:** Analyzes documents in a controlled environment to detect hidden threats without risking the main system.\n\n**3. Integration with Existing Security Systems:**\n\n- **SIEM and IDS/IPS Integration:** IoCs can be fed into these systems to enhance threat detection and response.\n- **Firewall and Proxy Integration:** Blocks known malicious URLs and files, preventing payload download.\n- **EDR and Antivirus:** Enhances detection with known IoCs and behavioral analysis, improving real-time threat response.\n\n**4. Compliance and Certification Details:**\n\n- **Patching Compliance:** Ensures compliance with security best practices by applying patches for known vulnerabilities, critical for regulatory standards like GDPR and HIPAA.\n- **Data Protection Regulations:** Mitigates risks of data breaches, aligning with regulations requiring robust security measures.\n\n**5. Security Best Practices for Users:**\n\n- **Regular Updates:** Keep software updated to patch vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-11882.\n- **Caution with Emails:** Avoid opening suspicious attachments or clicking links from unknown senders.\n- **Monitoring:** Use endpoint protection to monitor for suspicious activity and maintain antivirus updates.\n- **Backup:** Regularly back up critical data to mitigate ransomware risks.\n\n**6. Technical Specifications and Requirements:**\n\n- **Software Updates:** Microsoft Office must be updated beyond the patch for CVE-2017-11882.\n- **Antivirus Capabilities:** Requires solutions that detect known and unknown threats, analyze behavior, and integrate with security systems.\n- **System Hardening:** Restrict execution of unnecessary processes like EQNEDT32.EXE from svchost.exe.\n- **Network Monitoring:** Monitor traffic for hidden command-and-control activities, especially from Office documents.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe content highlights the importance of multi-layered security, including regular updates, email caution, and robust monitoring. By understanding and implementing these features and practices, users can enhance their security posture against such threats."
