In this post, were going to take a close look at a spam campaign from earlier this month to learn how versatile todays spammers truly are and highlight the potential for effectiveness that our spam-blocking service offers. Weve seen a rather fun spam attack in the last 24 hours . From this one site , we received eight styles of spam emails  Spam 1  Costco phishing attempts Spam 2  Solar panel product promotions Spam 3  4  Portable translation device advertisements two variations Spam 5  Leather holsters for concealed carry Spam 6  Miracle healing plant promotions Spam 7  Tea promising instant indigestion relief Spam 8  A rather amusing fat-burning fried foods cookbook This variation is just indicative of how flexible one spammer can be to hit different interests and vulnerabilities. Traditional spam filters have difficulty catching up. Our Adaptive Spam-Blocking Logic The most important thing learned from this campaign is how well our spam-blocking service worked. Although these emails were quite varied in nature, all of the variations were blocked using only one advanced spam-blocking logic. It is not dependent on some common identifying factors such as Sender IP addresses URLs within the emails Subject lines Instead, the system uses advanced algorithms to recognise spam patterns, so that even the most diversified campaigns from a single source can be caught. Steady Flow, Steady Block What was most interesting about this spam campaign, however, was the uniformity. For 12 hoursfrom 8 PM to 8 AM UTCweve seen a steady stream of approximately 2,740 spam emails, each firing off at 30-minute intervals. At this point alone, even with the varying topics, there is little doubt that these were all part of the same campaign. By the Numbers Total emails blocked in 24 hours  210,000 I nitial sending rate 2,740 emails per 30 minutes Peak sending rate 16,700 emails per 30 minutes From 2,740 to 16,700 emails per 30 minute  such a giant increase in the send rate  is an excellent example of how a spam campaign can easily scale up, arguing in favor of reliable, elastic spam protection. Red Flags and Spammer Tactics As we always say, the unsubscribe links in spam messages should actually not be clicked on . In this campaign, there were a few notes of interest All the unsubscribe links were actually fake and dangerous Four of the email specimens contained two separate unsubscribe footer sections, the information content of each being irreconcilable with the other Spam email 3 and 4 were practically the same, except for their headings  a typical use of spammers to send duplicate emails, hoping that one will bypass the block. Here you can see an instance in which advanced solutions of adaptive spam-blocking are required. Our service stayed a step ahead of the spammers, protecting mailboxes from a myriad of danger vectors.
