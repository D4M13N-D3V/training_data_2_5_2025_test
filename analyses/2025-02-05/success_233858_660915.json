This week our IAM Concept of the Week deals with FIDO  F ast Id entity O nline, an authentication technology largely based on biometrics. FIDO is supported by over 250 companies including Google, Microsoft and Salesforce and saw a 200 increase in adoption in 2016. The FIDO Alliance was created in 2013 by PayPal, Lenovo and others, with the goal of replacing passwords as the main method of authentication. Passwords, as we all know too well, are problematic from both a user experience, and security point of view. McKinsey research found that the average consumers now has 14 different passwords to remember, while a recent study by Verizon found that 63 of all data breaches involved the use of stolen, weak or default passwords. At the core of FIDO is the users smartphone, that uses cryptographic keys to securely authenticate with the FIDO-enabled server of the service or app the user is attempting to access. FIDO is made up of two sets of specifications or user experiences for authentication  UAF Universal Authentication Framework and U2F Universal Second Factor. UAF deals with passwordless authentication while U2F addresses the second factor authentication. Setting up FIDO authentication from a users perspective is straightforward. First the user selects an authentication method on their smartphone. The biometric method will depend on their preference, the capability of their phone, and the methods supported by the FIDO-enabled service. Once a method is selected, say a fingerprint, a biometric template is created along with a private and a public cryptographic key. The private key and biometric template are stored on the users device. The public key is sent to the FIDO-enabled server. Now, anytime the user needs to authenticate, the server just sends a challenge to the users device which is then signed by the private key and returned to the service to identify the user. The advantages of the FIDO approach are obvious Almost frictionless authentication No passwords to remember or reset The biometric data never leaves the phone so the approach is not vulnerable to server-based breaches On the other hand even though the biometric may remain securely on the device, biometrics like fingerprint records exist elsewhere, many times on government-controlled servers. If a biometric is compromised there is no easy way reset it like a password. Supporters of FIDO argue that the standard also includes non-biometrics methods like PIN or tokens and that for sensitive data multi factor authentication is a necessity. Ironically, many implementations of MFA include passwords as a possible factor. Only time will tell the extent to which FIDOs biometric authentication approach will reduce our dependence on the humble password.

    "content": "**Analysis of FIDO Authentication Based on the Provided Content**\n\n**1. Key Security Features and Benefits:**\n   - **Passwordless Authentication:** Eliminates the need to remember multiple passwords, reducing the risk of phishing and password-related breaches.\n   - **Biometric-Based and Cryptographic Keys:** Utilizes biometrics (e.g., fingerprints) and cryptographic keys for secure authentication, enhancing security compared to traditional passwords.\n   - **UAF and U2F Protocols:** UAF enables passwordless authentication, while U2F provides a second factor, increasing security without relying solely on passwords.\n\n**2. Compliance Certifications and Regulatory Adherence:**\n   - While the content doesn't specify certifications, FIDO is an industry-standard backed by major companies, implying alignment with regulatory requirements. Its adoption reduces password-related risks, a key compliance concern.\n\n**3. User-Focused Security Recommendations:**\n   - **Setup Guidance:** Users should select biometric methods available on their devices, follow setup steps for template and key creation, and understand the authentication process.\n   - **Backup Methods:** Encourage users to set up alternative authentication methods in case biometrics fail.\n\n**4. Technical Security Implementation Details:**\n   - **UAF and U2F:** Implementers should understand these protocols for different authentication needs.\n   - **Key Management:** Private keys stored on devices, public keys sent to servers, ensuring secure authentication through challenge-response mechanisms.\n\n**5. Data Protection Measures:**\n   - **Biometric Data Storage:** Data remains on devices, reducing server breach vulnerabilities.\n   - **No Password Storage:** Eliminates the risk of password breaches on servers.\n\n**6. Best Practices for End Users:**\n   - **Enable FIDO:** Use FIDO where possible to enhance security and convenience.\n   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA, preferably without password factors, to add security layers.\n   - **Device Security:** Keep devices and biometric data secure to prevent unauthorized access.\n   - **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor accounts for suspicious activities.\n\n**Considerations and Limitations:**\n   - **Biometric Vulnerability:** While FIDO secures biometric data, its presence elsewhere (e.g., government databases) poses risks beyond FIDO's control.\n   - **Lack of Explicit Compliance Details:** The content doesn't specify regulatory certifications, which could be a gap for users needing assured compliance.\n\nOverall, the content effectively introduces FIDO's benefits and mechanics, while highlighting areas for potential improvement in compliance and broader security practices.",
