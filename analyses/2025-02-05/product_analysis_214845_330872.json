What makes this one special is the scale and ingenuity of the attackers. Data443, one of the leading companies in data security and privacy solutions, managed one complex spam attack recently that very well brings out the critical need for advanced spam detection systems. This case study is an interesting example that elaborates on how Data443s technology protects users from malicious content. The Anatomy of a Sophisticated Spam Attack Recently, the Data443 team analyzed a far-reaching spam campaign covering multiple countries and languages that placed adult dating and online dating at the top of the list. There were several fronts on which this attack was significant Multi-lingual approach the spam emails were in English, Swedish, and German with a great number in the latter two languages. Valid platform abuse The attackers leveraged Googles Blogger for their malicious hosting and were hosting from many subdomains of 36 different top-level domains among them blogspot.com, blogspot.mx jp ae sg kr hk pt ro . Abnormally high volume for such attacks  Data443 detected close to 123,000 spam emails within a 7-day period, all targeting their customers. While this number might not be considered exceptionally high for general spam, it represents a significant volume specifically for this targeted attack. Shifting tactics Over 40 HTML and CSS code versions were deployed by the attackers in an effort to stay off the radar. Primarily, that was through incessant modification of template designs, texts, and images. Data443s Spam Detection in Action The sophisticated attack was timely identified and blocked due to the high effectiveness of Data443s spam detection system. Their solution handled this challenge in the following ways Content AnalysisMulti-lingual A system that could analyze content in multiple languages, be it English, Swedish, or German, brought forth the necessity of ascertaining any spam pattern, regardless of the language being used. Pattern Recognition Even though the attackers were trying to change the HTML and CSS code, there was an underlying structure and content to the emails that Data443s system was able to pick out. Volume Analysis In this case, Data443 analyzed email traffic patterns and found abnormal spikes in volume. The graph started off with peaks of 6,000 or so emails every 3 hours, gradually stabilizing at approximately 2,000 emails per 3-hour period. Still, that is a high volume, and its not possible to know if it will increase or decrease Image Content Analysis It noticed the variation in the types of images used, from only nude pictures in the first day and a half to nude and non-nude images. This is another instance of agility in content analysis, which is quite important in deciding new tactics of spam. Link and Domain Analysis The Data443 solution detected a pattern of links to Blogspot subdomains, but from an exceptionally large variety of top-level domains  an unusual characteristic for spam campaigns. With this spam attack ever evolving, cybersecurity experts and email providers are required to be vigilant and adaptive on their countermeasures all the time.

Be wary of unsolicited emails, especially those giving away adult content or dating opportunities.
