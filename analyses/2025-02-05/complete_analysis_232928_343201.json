      "user_guidance": "**End-User Guidance on Data Security and Protection During Tax Season**\n\n**1. Phishing Awareness:**\n- Be cautious with emails appearing to be from the IRS or tax software. The IRS typically communicates via mail, not email. Hover over links to check their source before clicking.\n\n**2. Password Security:**\n- Use strong, unique passwords for each account. Consider a password manager to keep track securely.\n- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on tax software and financial accounts for added security.\n\n**3. Secure Filing Practices:**\n- File taxes on a secure, private network. Avoid public Wi-Fi to prevent data interception.\n- Ensure devices are updated with the latest security patches and antivirus software.\n\n**4. Data Backup:**\n- Save tax documents on both external drives and secure, encrypted cloud services to prevent data loss.\n\n**5. Safe Sharing of Information:**\n- Use encrypted channels (e.g., encrypted email or secure portals) for sharing tax info.\n- Verify requests by phone, avoiding clicks on suspicious links or providing info via email.\n\n**6. Common Risks and Prevention:**\n- Recognize phishing attempts: Look for email red flags like spelling mistakes and suspicious senders.\n- Avoid fake IRS websites by checking for \"https\" and official URLs.\n\n**7. Privacy Measures:**\n- Shred paper documents and securely delete digital files.\n- Monitor bank and credit accounts for suspicious activity, setting up alerts for early fraud detection.\n\n**8. When to Seek Help:**\n- If you suspect identity theft, act quickly: freeze credit, report to the FTC, and contact the IRS.\n- Seek expert help if handling large amounts of sensitive data or managing a business.\n\n**9. Additional Resources:**\n- Contact IT departments or security professionals for support.\n- Visit FTC's identity theft resource page (identitytheft.gov) and IRS tax fraud resources for further guidance.\n\nBy following these guidelines, users can enhance their security and protect sensitive information during tax season."
