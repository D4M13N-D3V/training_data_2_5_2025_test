Security Budgets Up Sharply On average, survey respondents reported that IT security budgets grew a robust 17 during the past 12 months. Thats on top of a 21 increase reported one year ago in the first annual Cyren-Osterman Research survey. However, sixty-eight percent of businesses reported one or more breaches or infections during the prior 12 months, and significantly less than half believe they are well prepared to meet priority threats like ransomware, phishing and zero-day exploits . The survey focuses on the current web and email security status and priorities of IT and security managers at organizations with 100 to 3,000 employees. The survey results allow security personnel to benchmark their own security posture and planning against their peers. Figure 1 Ransomware is the top concern, up from 4 last year controlling employee behavior ranks last Some conclusions from the survey data which are covered in the report include Preference growing and nearly equal for cloud-based SaaS vs. on-premises The preference in terms of deployment model for security solutions is now nearly equally divided, with 32 percent preferring on-premises solutions, and 29 percent preferring cloud-based SaaS  with the latter up sharply from 21 percent in the 2016 Cyren-Osterman Research survey. Figure 2 Preference for cloud-delivered security versus on-premises appliances nearly equally divided. Email security is now predominantly done in the cloud Fifty-seven percent of SMBs rely on SaaS security for their email, considering together those who subscribe to a SaaS Secure Email Gateway 28 percent and those who rely on the security provided by their SaaS or hosted email service provider 29 percent. Cloud-based web security is moving up the adoption curve Eighteen percent of SMBs reported that they subscribe to SaaS web security, with another 16 percent reporting deployment of hybrid cloud and on-premises solutions, and six percent relying on a hosted virtual appliance. Security effectiveness and speed of defenses are most desired capabilities The misgivings around security performance were also apparent in the rankings of desired capabilities in new security solutions  security effectiveness 85 indicating highest importance and speed of defenses applied to new threats 74 were given significantly more weight by managers than cost and all other considerations. Growth in preference for cloud-based security Perhaps connected to their lack of confidence in current security capabilities, respondents also indicated they are open to new security approaches, with 29 of IT managers expressing a strong preference for cloud-based security. This is a notable increase from 21 in last years survey, and means that cloud-based security is almost at parity with on-premises security appliances as a preferred deployment model.

Security Best Practices**\n- **Regular Updates and Patches**: Ensure all software, systems, and devices are up-to-date with the latest security patches.\n- **Strong Passwords**: Implement strong, unique passwords and consider password management tools.\n- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enable MFA for all critical systems and services.\n- **Employee Training**: Conduct regular cybersecurity training to address phishing, ransomware, and data protection.\n- **Data Backups**: Regularly back up critical data and store backups securely, both on-site and in the cloud.\n- **Network Segmentation**: Segment networks to limit lateral movement in case of a breach.\n- **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and test an incident response plan to address breaches quickly.\n- **Leverage Cloud Solutions**: Consider cloud-based security solutions for scalability and efficiency, as indicated by the growing preference in the survey.\n\n##### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Data Classification**: Classify data based on sensitivity and implement appropriate protection measures.\n- **Encryption**: Use encryption for sensitive data both at rest and in transit.\n- **Access Control**: Restrict data access to only necessary personnel and systems.\n- **Email and Web Security**: Use cloud-based email security solutions (e.g., SaaS Secure Email Gateway) and ensure web security is up-to-date.\n- **Monitoring and Logging**: Continuously monitor and log access to critical data for unusual activity.\n\n##### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Phishing Awareness**: Train employees to recognize and report suspicious emails or links.\n- **Safe Browsing**: Avoid clicking on untrusted links and ensure websites use HTTPS.\n- **Device Security**: Ensure all devices, including personal ones used for work, have updated antivirus software and firewalls.\n- **Cloud Storage**: Use reputable cloud storage services and encrypt sensitive files before uploading.\n\n##### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Ransomware**: Regular backups and employee training can prevent infections. Use endpoint protection with anti-ransomware features.\n- **Phishing**: Conduct phishing simulations and train employees to spot attacks.\n- **Zero-Day Exploits**: Keep systems updated and use advanced threat protection solutions.\n- **Insider Threats**: Monitor user activity and enforce strict access controls.\n- **DDoS Attacks**: Use cloud-based DDoS protection services and ensure proper network configuration.\n- **Physical Theft**: Secure hardware and use encryption to protect data on stolen devices.\n- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Use VPNs for public Wi-Fi and encrypt sensitive communications.\n- **Unpatched Software**: Prioritize patching vulnerable systems quickly.\n- **Outdated Protocols**: Replace outdated protocols with modern, secure alternatives.\n- **Third-Party Risks**: Assess vendors' security practices and include security clauses in contracts.\n\n##### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Data Minimization**: Collect and retain only necessary data.\n- **Encryption**: Use encryption for sensitive data to protect privacy.\n- **Policies and Procedures**: Develop clear privacy policies and ensure compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n- **User Consent**: Obtain explicit consent for data collection and usage.\n- **Protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: Ensure PII is encrypted and access is restricted.\n- **Audit Logs**: Maintain logs of data access and modifications for accountability.\n- **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**: Appoint a DPO to oversee privacy and security efforts.\n\n##### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- **Major Security Incidents**: Engage experts if you experience a breach or significant attack.\n- **Compliance Requirements**: Consult with security professionals to ensure regulatory compliance.\n- **Complex Threats**: Seek help for advanced persistent threats or zero-day exploits.\n- **Internal Skills Gap**: Bring in experts if your team lacks the expertise or resources to handle security challenges.\n- **Audits and Assessments**: Perform regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.\n\n### **Key Takeaway**\nInvesting in security is crucial, but so is ensuring effectiveness and speed. SMBs should adopt a layered security approach, leveraging cloud-based solutions where possible, and focus on continuous improvement. Regular training, strong access controls, and robust incident response plans are essential to stay ahead of evolving threats.\n\nBy following these guidelines, SMBs can enhance their security posture, protect sensitive data, and build confidence in their ability to meet modern security challenges."
