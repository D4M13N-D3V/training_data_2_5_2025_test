The California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA will change how business is done in the Western World  there is no turning back now, and the new leverage that consumers will have with their data is only the beginning of a world that is moving towards global data governance. Now, is this a threat to your business? The answer is a resounding yes if you are unprepared, but if your organization is enabled with the proper systems to handle everything that this new world of consumer power is going to throw at you, then there is ample room for new competitive advantages and business successes. We saw this with GDPR , and CCPA is so heavily based on those laws  that history is bound to repeat itself. Lets run through some parts of CCPA where your business can benefit First of all, the Court is going to laugh at you if you break any of the laws and dont have any real solution in place for data governance at your company. Being an early adopter and having processes in place to facilitate consumer privacy will extend your leash with the Court of Law. Oh, how far we are from the days of consumers putting up with improper treatment from businesses. The reputation of your business and how it is perceived by consumers can be tarnished in one single incident of mishandled data. If they consumers cannot trust your business, they will leave  its that simple. Speaking of the consumers what CCPA is really about anyways, how do you think they are going to feel if you are able to show them that you arehave been 100 compliant with the law? Not all of your competitors will be able to do this  and again, if consumers are unable to trust a business, they will leave. Now lets talk about you, the business owner. When a consumer exercises their CCPA-given rights, or the auditors come knocking, do you want to be spending countless hours and dollars on giving them what they want, all for it to be not enough? A proper CCPA solution will enable you to completely avoid this, giving you an opportunity to direct your time and resources elsewhere. So, is there really a reason to fear the indoctrination of CCPA on January 1 st ? As long as your business is ready and has the proper processes in place to handle the mass amounts of consumer data you likely possess, there is nothing to worry about  in fact you should be quite excited, as CCPA will separate the competition into two sections those who can navigate the ever-increasing data governance landscape, and those who cant. Some businesses will bite the bullet and face massive fines. It was proved with GDPR, it is inevitable, and it will be upon us in only a few short months.
