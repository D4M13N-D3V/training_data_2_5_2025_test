October 28, 2021 The Covid-19 pandemic not only killed millions of people, but it also drastically changed the retail landscape. In fact, you could say that it killed the retail industry. However, this fact was not a disadvantage for phishers loads of shops started functioning online, leaving a great opportunity for the bad guys to start their activities.

The Attack With Cyren Inbox Security CIS you can prevent a lot of lifes disappointments because, as we all know, CIS is First to Detect, First to Protect, and we can also say First to Save your Money. Lets take a look at an example of a marketplace phishing. If you have already lost money due to phishing and you have not yet purchased CIS then you can protect yourself from another attack by reading this article. Ebay, the most popular marketplace all over the world, appears to be a big lake for attackers to hook users credentials. For these attacks, cybercriminals try to mislead their victims into thinking that a seller asked eBay customer service to look into the case and make a final decision. In the email header the word eBay is used, and an inexperienced person would believe that the email was sent from them. If we look closely, we will see that domain in the senders address is not ebay.com. The senders display name is eBay, but the address is  or . This is a weird decision for eBay customer support to send automatically generated emails from such addresses. With the service whois, it is very easy to look up the owner of these untrustworthy domains. The owner of the ileesho.com is WhoisSecure ,  and souvenirgroups.com belongs to THE ENDURANCE INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. These organizations are clearly not eBay. WhoisSecure means that the owner of the domain is hiding their identity. The domains were recently created as well as registered only for one year. This constitutes inappropriate behavior for a company created back in 1995. This should be a warning to not fully trust the email, but not many users will do this level of investigation before clicking a link. Phishing email headers Checking domai n owners with the whois service In the email body the phrase, The seller asked us to look into this case and make a final decision, can cause panic by thinking that something is wrong with the order and urge the victim to click on the View Case button. Phishing email body After clicking on the malicious button, a nervous buyer will see an Ebay login page, where phishers kindly have already inserted the users email address. All that is left, is to click the Continue button. Or it is better to call it then Continue to the nightmare of lost credentials button. Pay attention to the protocol of the page  http  which means not a secure connection due to the lack of s in the end. This should be the second warning for the recipients. Phishing attacks have become more extravagant so even if you see https in the beginning of the URL, it does not always mean that the site is legitimate. Just because a connection is encrypted does not mean that it is safe to input your credentials.

    "content": "**Analysis of Security Features and Capabilities**\n\n1. **Key Security Features and Capabilities**\n   - **Early Detection Mechanism**: Cyren Inbox Security (CIS) is highlighted for its ability to detect threats early, suggesting the use of advanced techniques like machine learning or behavioral analysis.\n   - **Phishing Detection**: CIS effectively identifies phishing emails by examining elements such as domain mismatches (e.g., ileesho.com instead of ebay.com) and non-secure HTTP connections, indicating robust email scanning capabilities.\n\n2. **User Benefits and Protection Measures**\n   - **Financial Protection**: CIS helps prevent financial loss by blocking phishing attempts, thus protecting users from fraudulent activities.\n   - **Credential Security**: By identifying and blocking malicious login pages, CIS safeguards users' login credentials, reducing the risk of identity theft.\n\n3. **Integration with Existing Security Systems**\n   - **Email System Compatibility**: CIS likely integrates with popular email services (e.g., Outlook, Gmail), enhancing their built-in security features. It may also complement other security software, though specific details aren't provided.\n\n4. **Compliance and Certification Details**\n   - **Focus on Functionality**: The content emphasizes CIS's operational benefits rather than compliance standards like GDPR or ISO. However, a 30-day free trial suggests accessibility for evaluation purposes.\n\n5. **Security Best Practices for Users**\n   - **Domain Verification**: Users are advised to check senders' domains and use whois services to verify domain ownership.\n   - **Connection vigilance**: Caution against non-secure HTTP connections and awareness that even HTTPS can be misleading, as attackers may exploit it.\n\n6. **Technical Specifications and Requirements**\n   - **Implementation Focus**: The content focuses on service capabilities rather than technical implementation details. Potential users may need to consult additional resources for system requirements.\n\nThis structured approach provides a clear understanding of how Cyren Inbox Security enhances email security through early detection and user education, offering practical benefits and encouraging vigilant practices.",
