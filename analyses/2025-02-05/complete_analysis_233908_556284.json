This offering provides immediate defensive benefits and long-term assurance that your network continues to be trustworthy Weve brought the expertise of our two companies together from different areas of the security industry to offer this unique solution, said Joe Saunders, CEO of RunSafe Security. The strength and value of this new approach is in its ability to protect both at the individual IoT device level and at the device communications pathway level. With a projected 19 trillion economic transformation around IoT connected devices as deployments increase and adoption continues at record pace, so too are new attack vectors. The out-of-the-box security measures for most devices are too weak and finding skilled IoT security experts is an ongoing challenge. Resilient IoT Guardian embodies a new approach to defending devices, infrastructure and networks from cyber attacks. Combining RunSafes ability to cyber-harden devices remotely by means of three-step transformation, with Resilient Network Systems access control middleware to enforce policies such as continuous authentication and dynamic whitelisting, Resilient IoT Guardian can protect new and deployed devices remotely and is scheduled to be available this summer. This offering provides immediate defensive benefits and long-term assurance that your network continues to be trustworthy, said Ethan Ayer, CEO of Resilient Network Systems. Instead of worrying about hacks and misuse of your devices, we give you visibility into your network and the ability to manage it.
