Some years ago, local authorities in the UK were targeted by a series of just such frauds. The modus operandi of the criminals was to masquerade as legitimate suppliers of building maintenance services and contact local authority finance departments, requesting their regular payments be made to new bank accounts. The tools of the trade? Letterheads and faxes. Roll the clock forward. Now, cybercriminals are using similarly simple techniques to conduct social engineering attacks against organizations with equally successful results as the latest report from Osterman  Phishing, BEC and Ransomware Threats for Microsoft 365 Users  clearly shows. Social engineering From Business Email Compromise BEC and Email Account Compromise EAC to Account Takeover ATO attacks, experts calculate as much as 91 of all cyberattacks start with a social engineering emails Deloitte 2020. Despite best efforts, these attacks keep on getting past traditional email security defenses and into users inboxes. Managing the problem is time-consuming, costly and a waste of valuable technical expertise. So how do you stop these attacks? Protect the Inbox For over 25 years the cybersecurity industry has focused on trying to protect email users by defending the network perimeter with a Secure Email Gateway SEG but evasive social engineering attacks have always found their way past these defenses. For more information on the short-comings of perimeter email security, read our threat intelligence report,  Beyond the Email Perimeter  Now Microsoft Office 365 email is used by the majority of organizations and though the security it offers is excellent, social engineering attacks continue to evade the native security controls and arrive in the inbox. To prevent these attacks from being successful, organizations need to employ an Integrated Cloud Email Security ICES solution that works in the inbox itself, automatically detecting and remediating attacks. Stop BEC, EAC, ATO, and attacks with no payload Often, social engineering attacks have a payload  for example a phishing URL or a malware-infected attachment such as one containing ransomware. The latter tend to make the headlines when they succeed, but these attacks can be automatically detected and remediated in the inbox by the ICES if it is powered by real-time analysis and the very latest threat intelligence. But what if the attack has been carefully crafted so it doesnt contain a payload? Business Email Compromise BEC, Email Account Compromise EAC and other social engineering email attacks dont have an obvious payload. Instead, they rely on techniques of trickery and impersonation to succeed. To combat them, look for an ICES that employs the very latest Artificial Intelligence AI techniques like Machine Learning ML and Natural Language Processing NLP detect and neutralize the attacks. An ICES which uses these techniques to analyze each message as it arrives in the inbox will stop this type of social engineering attack. Cyren uses AI to stop evasive attacks Cyren Inbox Security is an ICES that protects organizations from social engineering attacks like BEC, EAC, ATO, and imposter fraud, by working inside the inbox to find and automatically remediate messages irrespective of whether they have an obvious payload. It does this using a combination of machine learning, natural language processing, and heuristics to combat the threat. In my next blog, well look at how Cyren Inbox Security uses these techniques to examine the forensic evidence in social engineering attacks and automatically remediates them from the inbox.

    "content": "**Comprehensive Analysis of Security Content: Focus on BEC and AI Protection**\n\n**1. Key Security Features and Benefits:**\n- **AI-Powered Detection:** The solution uses Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect sophisticated attacks, including those without payloads, providing real-time analysis and automated remediation.\n- **In- Inbox Protection:** Operates directly within the inbox, enhancing detection capabilities beyond traditional Secure Email Gateways (SEGs), ensuring threats are mitigated closer to the user.\n\n**2. Compliance Certifications:**\n- The content does not specify compliance certifications. It is recommended that organizations verify if Cyren complies with standards like GDPR or ISO 27001 to ensure regulatory adherence.\n\n**3. User-Focused Security Recommendations:**\n- **Implement ICES:** Organizations should adopt Integrated Cloud Email Security (ICES) solutions to enhance email protection.\n- **Employee Training:** Regular training to recognize social engineering tactics and the importance of reporting suspicious emails.\n- **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and maintain a plan to quickly respond to and mitigate detected threats.\n\n**4. Technical Security Implementation Details:**\n- **Integration with Microsoft Office 365:** Ensures seamless protection for widely used email services.\n- **AI Models:** The solution utilizes ML and NLP for continuous threat detection and adaptation, suggesting a need for ongoing model training to maintain effectiveness.\n\n**5. Data Protection Measures:**\n- The content does not detail data handling practices or encryption. It is crucial for organizations to inquire about data sovereignty and encryption protocols to ensure secure data processing.\n\n**6. Best Practices for End Users:**\n- **Vigilance:** Caution with links and attachments, especially from unexpected sources.\n- **Verification:** Confirm requests for sensitive information through alternative channels.\n- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA to add an extra layer of security.\n- **Regular Audits:** Conduct routine security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.\n\n**Considerations and Limitations:**\n- Potential gaps in the content regarding compliance and data protection suggest areas for further investigation.\n- Consideration of AI limitations, such as false positives and the need for continuous model training, is important for a balanced approach.\n\nThis analysis highlights the strengths of AI-driven security solutions while emphasizing areas for further exploration to ensure a comprehensive security strategy.",
