In 2018, the underground phishing economy has come of age, with the evolution of phishing kits offering spoofed web pages  basic equipment for any phishing attack  a prime example. Phishing-as-a-Service as a broader phenomenon has ushered in a new era of sophistication and access for the low-level cybercriminal  democratizing phishing attacks.

Top 20 Brands Most Targeted in 2018 by Professional Phishing Kits Cyren analyzed 2,025 phishing kits during Q3 and Q4 2018, and our study showed which brands are most targeted by phishing kit developers, and also revealed which specific phishing kits are the most usedeffectively, which kits have the highest market share.

The top five phishing kits highlighted below are notable because they are high in volume, highly targeted and highly sophisticated  a trifecta that is emboldening low-level criminals to take on some of the biggest brandsand enterprises. 1  Multi-brand Microsoft Office 365 Phishing Kit The most-used phishing kit targets Microsoft Office 365 and Outlook credentials. While consumer brands still get the most overall phishing activity, its clear that the phishing-as-a-service market is meeting demand to penetrate enterprises, with the goal of finding deeper pockets. This kit was found in use most frequently with spoofed Office 365 login pages, but it is a multi-brand kitit also provides spoofed pages for AOL, Bank of America, Chase, Daum, DHL, Dropbox, Facebook, Gmail, Skype, USAA, Webmail, Wells Fargo, and Yahoo. 2  Microsoft Office 365 Phishing Kit This kit is specific to Office 365 phishing, and includes built-in techniques to evade detection, including blocking IPs and security bots and user agents to hide from standard phishing defenses. 3  PayPal Phishing Kit Unlike cheap and phony PayPal emails from yesteryear, this phishing kit employs new levels of sophistication, with several evasive techniques. Buyer and spender beware. 4  Multi-brand Kit If the Fortune 100 and a Swiss Army Knife had a Phishing Kit Baby, this would be it .

In this attack, cybercriminals are looking to capture credentials  both to access any enterprise files that might be stored there, and to see if those same credentials might unlock access to other enterprise accounts. Its example of how more phishing attacks are moving upstream and targeting enterprises. Key Phishing Trends to Watch While phishing has targeted large brands for some time, our analysis points to three significant trends brought on by a new generation of highly professional phishing kits Phishing-made-easy means more targeted attacks. With the new phishing kits, even technically unsophisticated would-be criminals have the tools, services and support they need to pursue specific, even local targets and evade detection. The professional phishing industry is prioritizing enabling enterprise attacks. While consumers and consumer brands still bear the brunt of most phishing activity, the most in-demand phishing attacks are exhibiting higher demand to penetrate enterprise accounts.
