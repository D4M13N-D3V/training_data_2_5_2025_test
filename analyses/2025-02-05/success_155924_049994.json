Most, if not all, of k-12 schools have implemented an email archiving solution  although, they may be looking for guidance as data volume increases and communication is taking place outside of email. Below is a list of 8 best practices for Educators to streamline Digital Communication Archiving within budget whilst remote learning Identify what you need to archiveindex While many schools have long since implemented email archiving solutions, the scope has been widened as institutes are using a variety of different platforms for communication amongst staff and students. The personal information of students as its defined in many state laws across the US is not limited to what is included in an email . Because of the many ways in which staff and students are communicating, it is important to identify your top 2-3 digital communication platforms and archive those in accordance to regulations. Make Regulations a Priority and Establish High Standard Policies Depending on the state in which your school operates, you may be subjected to state-tailored student data privacy laws and regulations. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act FERPA is to be examined intently as all schools receiving federal funds will fall under this regulation. However, it is important to investigate the specifics of your states student privacy law. Setting simple High Standard policies that can cover your bases across the different Federal and State Laws your school falls under helps save you time and budget  while holding your staff and students privacy to a high level. Ensure Data Is Accessible when needed for litigation or internal investigation Storing the data at your institute is the minimum legal requirement of many policies as this data needs to be accessed when it is called upon in litigation  or much more commonly, internal investigations . What happens when communication between staff members is called upon to solve a problem at your school? Well, this data needs to be located and extracted, so quick and easy eDiscovery searching must be enabled across all institutional storage. If the right data can be found quickly, internal investigation or even litigation processes can be expedited. Ensure you have enough space for influx of data Under normal circumstances, Digital Communication Archives can quickly become pricy as data storage needs grows. The same is even more so true now, with all communication being done digitally and the growing presence of collaborative solutions such as Zoom in the educational landscape. Because of this, purchasing additional unanticipated storage can quickly run up your budget if the solution is not priced and built to scale with your mass number of users. Automate retention policies The whole point of an archiving solution is to comply with rules and regulations, which heavily revolve around the retainment of emails and other communication between staff and students. Entrusting organization members to manually archive the correct data is a confusing, costly, and non-compliant process. Automated retention of all communications, set on policies pertaining to statefederal laws, is key in keeping costs down during this time  and ensuring data is easy to find during litigation or internal investigation. Automate Keyword Tagging and Indexing While many institutions will follow the same federal and state regulations, individual schools may have different personal needs or uses of archives. Internal investigations can be greatly assisted by the addition of keyword tagging, which is indexing data based on specific words or phrases . For example, if wanting to monitor all staff communication pertaining to a certain piece of sensitive information, setting automated keyword tags can help you identify and group all occurrences of this sensitive information  making it easier for the investigation team to find and analyze. If Regulations permit, go Cloud. If you have identified that regulations allow you to store your archives in the Cloud  do it. Building a largescale archiving infrastructure physically is complicated and requires maintenance and upkeep. In this time, institutes have a lot on their plate, and simplifying management of their archiving is critical. With Cloud Archiving, educators can lower the cost of ownership of their archives and allow for the flexibility to scale quickly , as upgrading storage and capabilities within a cloud solution is inherently quicker and easier than on-premise. Backup your Archives to avoid catastrophic loss Are you backing up your archived data to avoid catastrophic loss in the event of technical issue with your live systems? Institutes archives are filled with sensitive information and having quality backups ensures that staff  students data is kept safe. Storing backups in the cloud can also be a very effective method for budget-tight schools as there is no need to purchase physical infrastructure hardware. Quick access to the archives for litigation and internal investigations purposes is extremely important, especially during the event of a disaster  and without a backup, institutes can be lost.

    "content": "### Security Guidance for Data Protection and Compliance in Digital Communication Archiving\n\n#### 1. **Easy-to-Follow Security Best Practices**\n   - **Identify and Prioritize Data to Archive**: Focus on the most critical communication platforms used by your institution (e.g., email, Zoom, Slack, or Microsoft Teams). Archive only the data that is necessary for compliance, legal requirements, or operational needs.\n   - **Understand Regulations**: Familiarize yourself with federal and state laws such as FERPA, COPPA, and CCPA. Tailor your archiving policies to meet these regulations.\n   - **Automate Retention Policies**: Use automated tools to enforce retention schedules, ensuring data is kept for the required period and deleted responsibly after expiration.\n\n#### 2. **Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Ensure all archived data is encrypted at rest and in transit to protect against unauthorized access.\n   - **Secure Access Controls**: Limit access to archived data to authorized personnel only. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.\n   - **Regular Backups**: Implement a robust backup strategy to prevent data loss. Store backups in secure, separate locations (e.g., cloud or offsite storage).\n\n#### 3. **Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Train Staff and Students**: Educate users on secure communication practices, such as avoiding sensitive discussions in public channels and recognizing phishing attempts.\n   - **Monitor Usage**: Regularly audit communication platforms for inappropriate or illegal activities. Use monitoring tools to flag suspicious behavior.\n   - **Avoid Overloading Systems**: Be mindful of storage limits and avoid archiving unnecessary data to prevent system slowdowns or increased costs.\n\n#### 4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Data Breaches**: Protect against unauthorized access by ensuring strong passwords, enabling MFA, and regularly updating software.\n   - **Insufficient Storage**: Plan for scalability by choosing solutions that can grow with your data needs. Avoid last-minute, expensive storage upgrades.\n   - **Non-Compliance Risks**: Regularly review and update policies to align with changing regulations. Use automation to ensure consistent compliance.\n\n#### 5. **Privacy Protection Measures**\n   - **Student Data Protection**: Clearly define what constitutes student personal information (SPI) and ensure it is handled securely. Minimize the collection of SPI whenever possible.\n   - **Transparency**: Communicate with parents and students about how their data is collected, stored, and used. Provide opt-out options where applicable.\n   - **Anonymize Data**: Where possible, anonymize or pseudonymize data to protect individual identities while still meeting archiving requirements.\n\n#### 6. **When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n   - **Complex Legal Requirements**: If your institution operates in multiple states or countries with varying regulations, consult legal experts to ensure compliance.\n   - **Large-Scale Data Management**: If your archiving needs exceed your current capabilities, consider working with a reputable cloud provider or data security specialist.\n   - **Incident Response**: In the event of a data breach or internal investigation, bring in external experts to assist with forensics, recovery, and compliance reporting.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can streamline your digital communication archiving processes while ensuring compliance, security, and privacy. Regular reviews and updates to your policies will help you stay ahead of evolving challenges in the educational landscape.",
