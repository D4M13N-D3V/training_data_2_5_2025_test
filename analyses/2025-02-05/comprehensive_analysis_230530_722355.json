This seasons scams run the gamut, from traditional taxpayer phishing scams to more sophisticated fraud involving data stolen from accountants and tax preparers. Tax Preparers Are a Key Leverage Point Tax accountants and preparers are an obvious point of potential leverage for tax fraudsters. The IRS recently released a specific warning urging tax professionals to increase their level of cyber security and watch for emails carrying malware aimed at stealing client data. The scam works by first breaching the computer files belonging to tax accountants. The criminals steal the tax preparers client data, and then file a fake return with the IRS, using the taxpayers real bank account information to have the return deposited. The criminals then contact the victim and pretend to be the IRS or a debt collection agency, informing the victim that the deposit was made in error and they must redirect the deposit back to the IRSin reality a different bank account owned by the criminal.

Phishing for Tax Tool Credentials Phishing remains one of the most common tax fraud techniques, so learning how to identify phishing links can be helpful. In another recent scam reported by the IRS , this phishing scam attempts to steal passwords and data by tricking tax professionals into signing a new but fake e-Services user agreement a legitimate online tool for tax professionals from the IRS . One examplein a fake email claiming to be from e-Services Registration, and using the subject line of Important Update about Your e-Services Account, the phishing email informs the tax preparer that We are rolling out a new user agreement and all registered users must accept its revised terms to have access to e-Services and its products. The scam then uses a link to redirect the victim to a fake site to review and accept the agreement. While on the site, the victim is asked to provide user names and passwords. Human Resources Staff are Prized Targets In another increasingly common email scam, human resources staff are often targeted with emails impersonating the CEO and requesting copies of all the employee W-2 forms. Once the criminals have copies of the forms, theyll either use the data to file fraudulent tax returns or sell the data on the Dark Web. Example of a phishing email sent to the head of HR, impersonating the companys CEO. But Taxpayers Still the Main Target However, taxpayers still remain the number one target of cybercriminals during tax season. Many of these types of scams arrive in the victims email with an attached document containing instructions and links to phishing websites. Cyren identified two recent such scams, you can read about them here and here . Once the victim clicks the URL, he or she is often redirected to a website that goes to great lengths to appear legitimate, such as the one below, a tax refund-stealing site in Malaysia. Fraudulent phishing web site to steal tax refunds in Malaysia The victim then clicks his financial institutions logo and gets redirected to another fake banking site, where he or she is asked to provide sensitive information, including their user name, password, and bank account number.
