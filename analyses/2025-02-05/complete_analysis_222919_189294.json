  "content": "Search Free Trial Get Demo Discord Attack Targets NFT Projects November 3, 2021 Multiple Targets Discord AdministratorsModerators and NFT project members were targeted today in a well-planned social engineering attack . Attackers managed to take over sessions of some privileged Discord accounts and used them to send messages to serversusers in Discord. Since the messages and announcement came from moderators accounts, it is likely that users will trust the content of their messages. As narrated by kekwin.eth on twitter, the threat actors were able to grab the session token of his Discord account by luring him to a screen sharing session. From that point, it only took a screen grab of the Developer Tools logs in Discord to bypass authentication, including 2FA, and take control of the account. Axie Infinity Fake Announcement A fake announcement was sent to the official Axie Infinity Team Discord channel. Though the announcement was retracted as fast as the adminsmoderators could, a couple of fast users were able to click on the links and were duped into purchasing a fake NFT for Axie Infinity. As stated on their Discord channel, a staff member was similarly tricked into giving away his Discord access through the network logs of Chromes Developer Tools. The image above is of the notice from Discord of the hacked staff member account note the similarity to kekwin.eth incident. Its likely that the attacks are by the same group since they have very similar approaches and close timelines. Although steps have been taken to secure Discord channels and accounts, threat actors are always finding ways to trick unsuspecting users. If users train to learn how to secure their accounts and follow security guidelines, it could lead to a more stress-free online experience.

      "user_guidance": "### Security Guidance for Discord Users and NFT Project Members\n\n#### **1. Security Best Practices**\n   - **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Protect your Discord account by enabling 2FA in your account settings. Use an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator or Authy) instead of SMS-based 2FA for added security.\n   - **Use Strong, Unique Passwords:** Ensure your Discord password is strong and unique. Avoid reusing passwords from other platforms.\n   - **Monitor Account Activity:** Regularly check your account for any suspicious login attempts or unfamiliar devices connected to your account.\n   - **Be Cautious with Screen Sharing:** Avoid sharing your screen with untrusted individuals, as attackers can extract sensitive information from your browser's developer tools or browser logs.\n   - ** Educate Yourself and Others:** Stay informed about common social engineering tactics and share this knowledge with your team or community.\n\n#### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Backup Data:** Regularly back up sensitive data, including NFT project information, to a secure, encrypted location.\n   - **Encrypt Sensitive Information:** Use end-to-end encryption for sharing sensitive information, such as financial details or login credentials.\n   - **Limit Privileged Access:** Ensure only trusted individuals have access to privileged accounts (e.g., Discord administrators or moderators). Use role-based access control to minimize exposure.\n\n#### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Verify Announcements and Links:** Always verify the authenticity of announcements, especially those containing financial requests or links. Cross-check with official channels or directly with trusted team members before taking action.\n   - **Avoid Clicking on Suspicious Links:** Be cautious of links shared in public or private messages, even if they appear to come from trusted individuals. Hover over links to see the full URL before clicking.\n   - **Report Suspicious Activity:** If you notice unusual behavior, such as unexpected messages or announcements, report it to the relevant authorities immediately.\n   - **Lock Down Direct Messages (DMs):** Restrict who can send you direct messages in Discord settings to avoid unsolicited requests or phishing attempts.\n\n#### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Social Engineering Attacks:** Attackers may impersonate trusted individuals or moderators to gain your trust. Always verify the identity of the person contacting you.\n   - **Phishing Attempts:** Be wary of messages or emails asking for sensitive information, such as login credentials or wallet keys. Legitimate platforms will never ask for this information directly.\n   - **Session Hijacking:** Attackers steal session tokens to bypass 2FA and take control of accounts. Be cautious of screen-sharing requests and avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities.\n\n#### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n   - **Minimize Information Disclosure:** Avoid sharing personal or financial information publicly or in private messages. Use secure communication channels for sensitive discussions.\n   - **Use Privacy Tools:** Consider using a VPN and enabling browser extensions that block tracking scripts.\n   - **Review Permissions:** Regularly audit permissions for bots and applications connected to your Discord account. Remove any unnecessary or unused ones.\n\n#### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n   - **After a Potential Breach:** If you suspect your account or server has been compromised, immediately change your passwords, enable 2FA, and seek help from Discord support or a security expert.\n   - **For High-Value Assets:** If your server or project involves valuable assets (e.g., NFTs or cryptocurrencies), consider hiring a security professional to audit your setup and recommend additional protections.\n   - **For Ongoing Threats:** If your community is frequently targeted by attackers, consult with cybersecurity experts to implement advanced security measures, such as monitoring tools or employee training programs.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to social engineering attacks and other security threats. Stay vigilant, educate yourself and your team, and always err on the side of caution when interacting with unfamiliar requests or messages. Remember, security is an ongoing process, and staying informed is key to protecting yourself and your assets."
