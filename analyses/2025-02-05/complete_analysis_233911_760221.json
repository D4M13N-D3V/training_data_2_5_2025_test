There are still more questions than answers regarding this new ransomware campaign , but Cyren researchers have confirmed that the malware has married a derivation of last years Petya ransomware with the wormlike EternalBlue exploit, used by WannaCry only last month to spread from computer to computer via a vulnerability in a Microsoft file sharing protocol, details of which we discussed here . Email Inbox Identified, But Now Victims Cant Get their Decryption Keys This new Petya ransomware variant asks for the equivalent of 300 in Bitcoin to be transferred to the Bitcoin address 1Mz7153HmuxXTuR2R1t78mGsdzaAtNbBWX. You can see the account details and confer how many ransom payments have been at the Blockchain page here . After sending 300 worth of Bitcoin to the address, the victim is supposed to send his Bitcoin wallet ID and his personal installation key to the address  to receive the decryption key. It has now been confirmed that the e-mail provider Posteo has blocked this address, so even if you pay, you will not get the decryption key, since the attacker will not receive the victims e-mail. How It Works THe Petya variant uses the rundll32.exe process to run itself. Files are then encrypted by a file in the Windows folder called perfc.dat Sha-256 027cc450ef5f8c5f653329641ec1fed91f694e0d229928963b30f6b0d7d3a745. Petya schedules a task to reboot the victims computer within an hour. schtasks.exe  TR CWindowssystem32shutdown.exe r f The Master Boot Record MBR is modified in such a way that the encryption is carried out, and a custom bootloader is loaded that shows the ransom note and prevents the computer from booting into the Windows operating system. Here is the ransom note that is displayed after the computer has rebooted Doesnt Use a New Extension Petya encrypts files with the following file extensions, but does not add a new extension like most ransomware today 3ds .7z .accdb .ai .asp .aspx .avhd .back .bak .c .cfg .conf .cpp .cs .ctl .dbf .disk .djvu .doc .docx .dwg .eml .fdb .gz .h .hdd .kdbx .mail .mdb .msg .nrg .ora .ost .ova .ovf .pdf .php .pmf .ppt .pptx .pst .pvi .py .pyc .rar .rtf .sln .sql .tar .vbox .vbs .vcb .vdi .vfd .vmc .vmdk .vmsd .vmx .vsdx .vsv .work .xls .xlsx .xvd .zip Cyren detects the Petya ransomware attack as W32Ransom.Petya.J!Eldorado.
