Additionally, the product supports Optical Character Recognition (OCR) classification, which allows for the automatic identification and classification of sensitive data within unstructured content, such as images and scanned documents.\n\n- **Support for Zoom and Endpoint Scanning:** ClassiDocs supports data classification for Zoom, ensuring that sensitive information shared during virtual meetings is protected. The platform also scans laptops and desktops, ensuring that sensitive data is identified and protected across all endpoints.\n\n- **COVID-19 Taxonomies and Patterns:** The product includes taxonomies and patterns specifically designed to identify and classify COVID-19-related data, which is critical for organizations handling sensitive health information.\n\n- **Integration with Microsoft Azure:** The integration of ClassiDocs with Microsoft Azure's Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) protection system ensures that organizations can leverage the scalability and security of the cloud while maintaining full control over their encryption keys.\n\n#### 2. **Compliance Certifications and Regulatory Adherence**\n\nData443's ClassiDocs product is designed to support compliance with various global data protection regulations, including:\n\n- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):** ClassiDocs supports GDPR compliance through its data classification, governance, and privacy management capabilities.
