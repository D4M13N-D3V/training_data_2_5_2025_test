      "user_guidance": "To protect yourself from tax scams and ensure data security during tax season, follow this organized and elegant approach:\n\n1. **Verify Communications:**\n   - Be cautious with unsolicited emails, calls, or texts. Verify by contacting the IRS through official channels found on their website, not the provided contact info.\n\n2. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**\n   - Activate MFA on all tax-related accounts to add an extra layer of security.\n\n3. **Use Strong Passwords:**\n   - Implement a password manager to create and store unique, complex passwords for each account.\n\n4. **Keep Software Updated:**\n   - Enable automatic updates on devices and check monthly for any pending updates.\n\n5. **Secure Data Backups:**\n   - Store backups on both an external drive and a secure cloud service. Choose a cloud provider with robust security features.\n\n6. **Safeguard Sensitive Documents:**\n   - Store documents in a locked cabinet or safe. Shred unnecessary documents with personal info.\n\n7. **Use Secure Wi-Fi:**\n   - Avoid public Wi-Fi for tax tasks; use a VPN if necessary. Ensure tax websites use \"https\" and display a padlock icon.\n\n8. **Avoid Phishing Attempts:**\n   - Watch for urgent language, spelling errors, and generic greetings. Hover over links to check destinations before clicking.\n\n9. **Monitor for Security Risks:**\n   - Be alert to spear-phishing, ransomware, and social engineering tactics. Verify unexpected attachments before opening.\n\n10. **Protect Privacy:**\n    - Monitor financial accounts for suspicious activity and set up transaction alerts. Consider freezing your credit reports.\n\n11. **Physical Security Measures:**\n    - Cover webcams when not in use to prevent potential hacking.\n\n12. **Seek Help When Needed:**\n    - Contact IRS and FTC if you suspect a scam. Report incidents to the appropriate authorities and keep records.\n\n13. **Educate Yourself:**\n    - Regularly visit the IRS website for updated scam information and guidance.\n\n14. **Research Tools:**\n    - Investigate reliable VPN services for public Wi-Fi use and understand the credit freeze process through credit bureau websites.\n\nBy systematically addressing each aspect, you can enhance your security posture and reduce the risk of falling victim to tax scams."
