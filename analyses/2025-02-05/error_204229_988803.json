Data443 Founder and CEO, Jason Remillard, commented We look forward to expanding our relationship with the dynamic community at Research Triangle Park and leveraging all that it has to offer and attract, such as an excellent pipeline of talent via the STEM RTP program and other partnerships between the Research Triangle Foundation, industry, and academia including access to graduate students from world-class universities, access to service members participating in the U.S. DODs Skillbridge Program, and the interest of venture capital firms and strategic investors. We expect our new offices in Research Triangle Park will benefit our company and employees as we prepare to ramp up the operations we project will lead to our continued growth. Competition in tech for new talent of all experience levels remains fierce, and the industry continues to face challenges in retaining and motivating high caliber personnel.
