This week our IAM Concept of the Week deals with FIDO  F ast Id entity O nline, an authentication technology largely based on biometrics. FIDO is supported by over 250 companies including Google, Microsoft and Salesforce and saw a 200 increase in adoption in 2016. The FIDO Alliance was created in 2013 by PayPal, Lenovo and others, with the goal of replacing passwords as the main method of authentication. Passwords, as we all know too well, are problematic from both a user experience, and security point of view. McKinsey research found that the average consumers now has 14 different passwords to remember, while a recent study by Verizon found that 63 of all data breaches involved the use of stolen, weak or default passwords. At the core of FIDO is the users smartphone, that uses cryptographic keys to securely authenticate with the FIDO-enabled server of the service or app the user is attempting to access. FIDO is made up of two sets of specifications or user experiences for authentication  UAF Universal Authentication Framework and U2F Universal Second Factor. UAF deals with passwordless authentication while U2F addresses the second factor authentication. Setting up FIDO authentication from a users perspective is straightforward. First the user selects an authentication method on their smartphone. The biometric method will depend on their preference, the capability of their phone, and the methods supported by the FIDO-enabled service. Once a method is selected, say a fingerprint, a biometric template is created along with a private and a public cryptographic key. The private key and biometric template are stored on the users device. The public key is sent to the FIDO-enabled server. Now, anytime the user needs to authenticate, the server just sends a challenge to the users device which is then signed by the private key and returned to the service to identify the user. The advantages of the FIDO approach are obvious Almost frictionless authentication No passwords to remember or reset The biometric data never leaves the phone so the approach is not vulnerable to server-based breaches On the other hand even though the biometric may remain securely on the device, biometrics like fingerprint records exist elsewhere, many times on government-controlled servers. If a biometric is compromised there is no easy way reset it like a password. Supporters of FIDO argue that the standard also includes non-biometrics methods like PIN or tokens and that for sensitive data multi factor authentication is a necessity. Ironically, many implementations of MFA include passwords as a possible factor. Only time will tell the extent to which FIDOs biometric authentication approach will reduce our dependence on the humble password.

    "content": "**End-User Guidance on Data Security and Protection with FIDO Authentication**\n\n**Introduction:**\nFIDO (Fast Identity Online) offers a secure alternative to traditional passwords by using biometrics like fingerprints. Supported by major companies, FIDO aims to enhance security and user experience. This guide provides practical advice for using FIDO effectively.\n\n**1. Security Best Practices:**\n   - **Enable FIDO:** Check if your services support FIDO and enable it for added security.\n   - **Use Biometrics or PIN:** Opt for fingerprint or PIN as a second factor for convenience and security.\n   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Use MFA for sensitive accounts to add an extra layer of protection.\n\n**2. Data Protection Recommendations:**\n   - **Keep Devices Updated:** Regularly update your devices to protect against vulnerabilities.\n   - **\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4:** Exercise caution when using biometrics in public to avoid exposure.\n\n**3. Safe Usage Guidelines:**\n   - **Avoid Unsecure Environments:** Be cautious using biometrics in insecure settings to prevent unauthorized access.\n   - **Phishing Awareness:** Stay vigilant against phishing attempts, as FIDO doesn't protect against social engineering.\n\n**4. Common Security Risks and Prevention:**\n   - **Biometric Compromise Risks:** Understand that compromised biometrics can't be reset; use MFA for sensitive data.\n   - **Use Password Managers:** For accounts without FIDO, manage passwords securely with a reputable manager.\n\n**5. Privacy Protection Measures:**\n   - **Be Mindful of Surroundings:** Avoid using biometrics where others might observe or record your details.\n\n**6. When to Seek Additional Support:**\n   - **Contact IT Support:** Reach out if you encounter issues or suspect a security breach.\n   - **Enhanced Security Measures:** Consider additional protections for high-risk accounts.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTransitioning to FIDO can significantly improve your security. By understanding its benefits and limitations, you can use it effectively while maintaining vigilance against potential risks. Follow these guidelines for a smoother, more secure experience.\n\n---\n\nThis guide is designed to be easy to understand and apply, helping users enhance their security without complexity.",
