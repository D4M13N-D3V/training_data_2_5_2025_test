      "user_guidance": "### Security Guidance for End-Users\n\n#### 1. **Easy-to-Follow Security Best Practices**\n   - **Use Strong, Unique Passwords:** Avoid using the same password across multiple accounts. Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.\n   - **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to your phone) when logging in to accounts.\n   - **Keep Software Updated:** Regularly update your operating system, browser, and applications to protect against vulnerabilities.\n   - **Be Cautious with Emails and Links:** Avoid opening suspicious emails, clicking on links, or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Verify the sender\u2019s identity before taking any action.\n\n#### 2. **Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Backup Your Data:** Regularly back up important files to an external drive or cloud storage service.\n   - **Encrypt Sensitive Data:** Use encryption for sensitive files, especially when sharing them over the internet.\n   - **Use Secure Communication Channels:** Avoid sharing sensitive information via unsecured channels like plain text emails. Use encrypted messaging apps or platforms instead.\n\n#### 3. **Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Avoid Using Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Tasks:** Public Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured. Avoid accessing banking, email, or other sensitive accounts while using public Wi-Fi.\n   - **Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN):** If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic.\n   - **Log Out of Accounts:** Always log out of your accounts, especially when using shared devices.\n\n#### 4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Phishing Attacks:** Be wary of emails, calls, or texts that ask for personal information. Verify the identity of the sender before responding.\n   - **Malware:** Only download software or files from trusted sources. Run regular antivirus scans to detect and remove malicious software.\n   - **Social Engineering:** Be cautious of unsolicited requests for information or actions. Always verify the legitimacy of the request through a separate communication channel.\n\n#### 5. **Privacy Protection Measures**\n   - **Minimize Data Sharing:** Only share personal information when necessary, and ensure you are doing so with trusted parties.\n   - **Use Privacy Settings:** Adjust the privacy settings on social media and other online accounts to limit who can see your information.\n   - **Secure Your Devices:** Use a screen lock or biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint or face recognition) to protect your devices from unauthorized access.\n\n#### 6. **When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n   - **After a Security Incident:** If you suspect your account or device has been compromised, change your passwords immediately and contact a security professional.\n   - **For Complex Systems:** If you\u2019re managing sensitive data or complex systems, consider consulting with a cybersecurity expert to ensure proper security measures are in place.\n   - **For Training and Education:** Regular training can help you and your team stay informed about the latest security threats and best practices. Consider enrolling in a cybersecurity awareness program.\n\nBy following these practical guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches, phishing attacks, and other security threats. Stay vigilant and proactive in protecting your data and privacy."
