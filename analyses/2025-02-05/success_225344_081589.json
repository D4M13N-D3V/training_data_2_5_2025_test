To learn which brands were the most frequently targeted by phishers, Cyren analysts extracted about a million URLs recently classified as phishing. There were very few surprises and the top 20 contained almost all the same brands as our previous report, in which we used data from Q1 of 2018. There was one very conspicuous change  IRS.gov does not feature, because clearly tax fraud is only a valid activity in Q1, tax season. This selection of online brands by phishers provides a useful indicator of phishing motivation Financial sites are clearly targets because stolen credentials provide criminals with direct access to money andor bitcoins, in addition to login credentials that could be resold on the black market. Online services, such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft serve as an Attack Platform for cybercriminals stolen credentials from a list of Gmail or Apple subscribers can be resold or possibly used to hack other websites, since many people use the same credentials user names  passwords for login on multiple sites. Additionally, email or social media logins can be used to target contacts of the victim. Shopping or commerce websites, such as Amazon and Alibaba offer criminals both credential information and the possibility of online shopping sprees or financial data if the victim stores credit card or banking information with the online services.

    "content": "The provided content offers insights into phishing trends and motivations but lacks detailed information on security solutions and compliance. Here's a structured analysis focusing on the required areas:\n\n1. **Key Security Features and Benefits**:\n   - **Threat Detection and Analysis**: Cyren's analysis of phishing URLs helps identify trends and targets, aiding in preemptive security measures.\n   - **Incident Response Preparedness**: Understanding phishing patterns allows organizations to enhance response strategies.\n   - **User Awareness Programs**: Highlighting targeted brands can educate users about phishing risks, encouraging vigilance.\n\n2. **Compliance Certifications and Regulatory Adherence**:\n   - The content does not mention specific certifications, which is a gap. Highlighting compliance with standards like SOC 2 or ISO 27001 could build trust.\n\n3. **User-Focused Security Recommendations**:\n   - **Caution with Emails**: Users should be wary of unsolicited emails and verify senders before clicking links.\n   - **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Encourages adding an extra security layer to accounts.\n   - **Suggested Improvements**: Recommend password managers and detailed guidance on spotting phishing attempts.\n\n4. **Technical Security Implementation Details**:\n   - **Machine Learning and Threat Intelligence**: Likely used by Cyren to detect phishing, though not explicitly mentioned.\n   - **Traffic Monitoring**: Inferred but not detailed; specifying such measures would provide clarity.\n\n5. **Data Protection Measures**:\n   - **Credential and Financial Data Protection**: Awareness of risks is mentioned, but specifics on encryption or access controls are missing.\n\n6. **Best Practices for End Users**:\n   - **Safe Shopping Tips**: Expand advice to include secure connections (HTTPS) and verifying website legitimacy.\n   - **Account Security**: Emphasize beyond 2FA, such as regular password updates and monitoring account activity.\n\n**Conclusion**: The content effectively highlights phishing risks but could benefit from elaborating on Cyren's security features, compliance, and offering more detailed user guidance. Expanding these areas would provide a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity.",
