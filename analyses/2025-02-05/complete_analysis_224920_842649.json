New Buyers Guides give a framework and provide a checklist to get it right. Over the last few years, the way businesses use technology has undergone a complete transformation, driven by two major trends  mobility and cloud application adoption. At the same time, we are seeing constant evolution of internet threats, which when combined with mobility and cloud, is putting huge pressure on traditional security infrastructure. Cyber threats are becoming more frequent, sophisticated and evasive. The majority start with a malicious email, resulting in email security being one of the main focus areas for cyber security spend, second only to firewalls. Figure 1 Framework for selecting email and web security solutions covered in new Buyers Guide Office 365 Migration Creates Special Issues Everyone who works in IT already understands this of course, but why suggest that Office 365 has any bearing on the email security buying process? There are two parts to the answer. The first is that, through no fault of Microsofts, Office 365 is a victim of its own success. In much the same way that the popularity of Windows resulted in it being targeted by cyber criminals, as the number of Office 365 users increases rapidly, so do the threats specifically targeting those users. Cyren Security Lab research into phishing kits available on the dark web found that kits that phish for Office 365 credentials comprised 25 of the total number being sold. As a consequence, IT and information security professionals with Office 365 deployed are increasingly finding themselves challenged to ensure their email security controls protect their users, company, business partners and customers. The second part of the answer is related to this challenge. The choices available to those evaluating email security products and services today are many and confusing. For companies that have migrated to Office 365, the inclusion of some bundled, basic email security exacerbates the complexity of this process. Buyers Guides Now Available to Navigate Complexity Large enterprises are having their fair share of difficulty in defending against modern internet threats, but they are more likely than not advantaged in terms of planning resources. They have dedicated security teams who assess their security posture and understand the technical, process and people controls that they need to put in place to mitigate the risks to the business. If well-organized, they are able to specify required functionality and work with the messaging infrastructure and operations teams to evaluate products and services. Smaller and mid-sized enterprises will often not pursue the same depth of analysis and planning, as they are likely more budget and resource constrained. Here at Cyren we do believe that the email security buying process has become more difficult, so to help those needing to cut through the complexity we have created a 27-page buyers guide specifically for Office 365 customers, as well as a general buyers guide relevant for those looking for any system, along with other resources also available at those links.

      "user_guidance": "### End-User Guidance on Data Security and Protection for Office 365\n\nStaying secure in today's digital world requires a combination of awareness, best practices, and the right tools. Office 365, while incredibly powerful, is a prime target for cybercriminals due to its popularity. Here\u2019s a practical guide to help you protect yourself and your organization:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Security Best Practices**\n- **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**: Avoid using the same password across multiple accounts. Consider using a password manager to securely store complex passwords.\n- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to your phone) in addition to your password.\n- **Keep Software Updated**: Ensure your operating system, browser, and Office 365 apps are up to date to protect against vulnerabilities.\n- **Back Up Your Data Regularly**: Use cloud backup solutions or external drives to safeguard your files, as ransomware or accidental deletions can wipe out critical data.\n- **Monitor Account Activity**: Regularly review your login history and report any suspicious activity to your IT team.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use encryption for files or emails containing sensitive information, such as financial data or personal identifiable information (PII).\n- **Use Office 365\u2019s Built-in Security Features**:\n  - Enable **Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)** to scan emails for malicious content and links.\n  - Turn on **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** to monitor and prevent unauthorized sharing of sensitive data.\n- **Classify Data**: Use sensitivity labels in Office 365 to classify emails and documents based on their confidentiality level.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Beware of Phishing Attacks**:\n  - Be cautious with emails asking for login credentials, financial information, or urgent action. These could be phishing attempts.\n  - Verify the sender\u2019s email address and hover over links to check their destination before clicking.\n- **Avoid Opening Suspicious Attachments**: If you weren\u2019t expecting a file, don\u2019t open it without verifying the sender\u2019s identity.\n- **Use Office 365\u2019s phishing reporting tool**: If you suspect an email is a phishing attempt, report it using the built-in **Report Message** feature.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Ransomware Risks**: Ransomware attacks often start with a phishing email or malicious link. Regular backups and prompt reporting of suspicious emails can help prevent these attacks.\n- **Insufficient Access Controls**: Ensure that files and folders are shared only with those who need access.\n- **Malicious Links and Payloads**: Hover over links before clicking and avoid entering credentials on unfamiliar websites.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Limit Third-Party App Permissions**: Be cautious when granting permissions to third-party apps connected to your Office 365 account.\n- **Use Office 365\u2019s Privacy Settings**: Adjust your privacy settings to control what data is shared and with whom.\n- **Educate Employees**: Regular training sessions can help employees understand the importance of privacy and how to protect sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- **If You Suspect a Breach**: If you\u2019ve clicked on a suspicious link or provided credentials to a phishing site, immediately change your password and notify your IT team.\n- **For Advanced Threats**: If you\u2019re facing repeated or sophisticated attacks, consider consulting cybersecurity experts or adopting additional security tools.\n- **When Migrating to Office 365**: Ensure your migration process is secure by consulting with security professionals to avoid potential vulnerabilities during the transition.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\nOffice 365 is a powerful tool, but its security depends on how you use it. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and protect your organization from cyber threats. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and always err on the side of caution when dealing with sensitive information.\n\nFor more resources, check out:\n- Microsoft\u2019s Office 365 Security & Compliance page.\n- Third-party buyers guides for email security solutions."
