December 21, 2019 Businesses need to map personal information now to have full control and insight into all customer data, or Personal Information PI as defined by the CCPA . How Do I Map Personal Information in My Business for CCPA? To comply with the CCPAs definition of Personal Information , businesses must build a full map of all customer data. Any information that can be used to draw inferences about a customer is covered by the law. So businesses are responsible for drastically broadening their view and control of consumer data. The first solution to this challenge that comes to mind is building a data inventory. Normally, data inventories are built by simply throwing together all conduits of data within your organization. Then writing reports based on what is being asked for. Unfortunately, with the extremely expansive requirements of the act, this type of legacy solution will inherently not meet the basic requirements. A CCPA specific data map is the key to governance over customer Personal Information in the age of this new law. As this law intends, businesses must be compliant with many different consumer empowering laws. And, must map all Personal Information across their business  within the strict time constraints of the law, and without blowing their budget.

Gain competitive advantages While businesses operating in California are seemingly at a disadvantage compared to their non-Californian counterparts. Its important to note many other states have introduced similar laws. Those businesses already in compliance with the Californian law will be well-positioned to compete in these markets. The regulation can provide a competitive advantage to those successfully operating under it. As there will be significant barriers to businesses looking to enter their Californian market. Utilizing Data443s GPM, businesses can leverage compliancy into processes that are compliant under all consumer data privacy laws in the world. Compliancy can develop into a core competency for business. And, that can be used to further cement their competitive position in the marketplace. Businesses in the US must start taking data ownership very seriously. We saw with GDPR, a lot of organizations were not ready and faced massive consequences. As the law intends, organizations must now be in full control of their data from top to bottom. This data must be constantly up to date, accurate, and fully accessible. Many companies are still mapping their data with surveys. And the true extent of this mishandling of data will become evident when CCPA is introduced  just like it did with GDPR. Compliancy does not have to cause anxiety and worry to business owners inoperating-in California. This law is being introduced to move the power of data back into the hands of the customer. Thus, creating room for significant space to develop between competitors in the realm of customer trust and relationships. Data443s Global Privacy Manager GPM was built specifically for the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA. It can help businesses cultivate compliancy and control their customers Personal Information.
