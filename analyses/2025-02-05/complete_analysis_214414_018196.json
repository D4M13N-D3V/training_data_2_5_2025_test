We delivered strong results that were on target and to our forecasts. We continue to make solid progress toward achieving our long-term goals in delivering a complete data privacy, security and governance ecosystem that is unique and unrivaled in the marketplace. Our product portfolio continues to deliver value to the marketplace and provide diversified revenue streams for the company  especially valuable particularly at these challenging times. Continued high margin-based product lines are contributing to our growing bottom line. 2019 represents these roll up businesses reporting only approximately 1.5 and 2.75 quarters contributing for the fiscal  thus enabling for significant expected contributions for 2020. We have made great strides in executing on our vision for success, to position Data443 as a leading provider of data privacy and security services that meet the growing challenges faced by organizations in highly regulated, risk and compliance-intensive markets. Weve acquired long-standing businesses with high quality intellectual property and talent, producing monthly recurring revenue with very strong renewal rates. Weve successfully integrated these businesses within Data443, providing our clients with a growing portfolio of services at their disposal. In the current COVID-19 environment, we are fortunate that our services continue to be used by a diverse group of customers whose businesses are continuing to operate, with several considered to be an essential service. We are highly engaged with our customers helping them to navigate the new challenges they are facing, continuing to fully service their needs during these difficult times. Our employees remain fully engaged, and we believe our business continuity plan is working well. We are the only organization in the marketplace that provides the effective end to end solution for privacy compliance management. Our most recent launch of the Global Privacy Manager back ended by the leading ClassiDocs product is indicative of the end to end solution  providing a privacy management solution for clients of all sizes, in all locations with clients of all types. Our mission is to provide capabilities for all of these customers and enable them immediately at prices and onboarding times that are consumable and relevant to their needs. As the California AG has reiterated as recently as last week  the CCPA will be enforced with rigor starting July 2020 and we look forward to helping our customers through these trying times. In conclusion, I want to thank our loyal employees, customers and shareholders for your continued support. Much like many other microcap companies, our stock price today clearly doesnt represent what I believe to be the underlying value of Data443. We continue to improve execution, drive additional revenue and close acquisitions that are accretive and fit within our unique framework, concluded Mr. Remillard.

      "user_guidance": "### Data Security and Protection Guidance\n\nAs a security advisor, I\u2019ve compiled practical, easy-to-follow guidance to help you protect your data and maintain privacy. These recommendations are designed to be actionable and understandable for all users.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Security Best Practices**\n- **Use Strong Passwords**:  \n  - Create unique, complex passwords for every account (e.g., a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols).  \n  - Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts.  \n  - Use a password manager to securely store credentials.  \n\n- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:  \n  - Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to your phone or a biometric scan) when logging in to accounts.  \n\n- **Keep Software Updated**:  \n  - Regularly update operating systems, browsers, and applications to patch security vulnerabilities.  \n  - Enable automatic updates where possible.  \n\n- **Be Cautious with Emails**:  \n  - Avoid opening suspicious emails, attachments, or links from unknown senders. These could be phishing attempts.  \n  - Verify the sender\u2019s identity before responding or clicking on links.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Backup Your Data**:  \n  - Regularly back up important files to an external drive or cloud storage service (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox).  \n  - Use the 3-2-1 backup rule: three copies, two different media, and one offsite backup.  \n\n- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**:  \n  - Use encryption for files or folders containing personal or sensitive information.  \n  - Enable full-disk encryption for laptops and mobile devices.  \n\n- **Secure Data in Transit**:  \n  - Use secure communication tools like encrypted messaging apps (e.g., Signal, WhatsApp) and virtual private networks (VPNs) when connecting to public Wi-Fi.  \n\n- **Limit Data Access**:  \n  - Only share sensitive data with trusted individuals or organizations.  \n  - Use role-based access controls to ensure only authorized users can access specific data.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Public Wi-Fi Safety**:  \n  - Avoid accessing sensitive accounts (e.g., banking, email) when connected to public Wi-Fi.  \n  - Use a VPN to encrypt your connection if you must use public Wi-Fi.  \n\n- **Mobile Device Security**:  \n  - Enable screen locks or biometric authentication for your phone or tablet.  \n  - Install security updates and antivirus software on mobile devices.  \n\n- **Physical Security**:  \n  - Keep devices (e.g., laptops, USB drives) in secure locations to prevent theft or unauthorized access.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Phishing Attacks**:  \n  - Be vigilant about unsolicited emails, calls, or texts asking for personal information.  \n  - Hover over links to verify their destination before clicking.  \n\n- **Malware and Ransomware**:  \n  - Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources.  \n  - Use reputable antivirus software to scan your device regularly.  \n\n- **Data Leakage**:  \n  - Double-check recipients before sending emails or files.  \n  - Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools to monitor and prevent unauthorized data transfers.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Understand Privacy Policies**:  \n  - Review privacy policies of apps and services to understand how your data is used.  \n\n- **Use Privacy Tools**:  \n  - Enable privacy settings on social media and apps to limit data sharing.  \n  - Use tools like browser extensions (e.g., uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger) to block trackers.  \n\n- **Comply with Regulations**:  \n  - Familiarize yourself with privacy laws like GDPR, CCPA, or LGPD, which protect your rights to data privacy.  \n  - Use tools like Global Privacy Manager to streamline compliance efforts.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- **Data Breach or Theft**:  \n  - Contact IT support or a cybersecurity professional immediately if you suspect your data has been compromised.  \n\n- **Unresolved Security Issues**:  \n  - If you encounter repeated phishing attempts, malware infections, or unauthorized access, seek help from a security expert.  \n\n- **Large-Scale Data Handling**:  \n  - If your organization manages sensitive or regulated data (e.g., healthcare records, financial information), consult with a data protection officer or cybersecurity firm.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Tip: Stay Informed\n- Regularly educate yourself about emerging threats, such as new phishing tactics or ransomware variants.  \n- Follow cybersecurity news and blogs to stay updated on best practices.  \n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce your risk of data breaches, identity theft, and privacy violations.
