While waiting for an agent to take my call, I browsed through Facebook to look for their support page. Unfortunately, I found two pages that looked almost exactly alike. The difference was the verified badge on the legitimate page and the About info as shown below. Figure 1 Legitimate bank page on the left, fraudulent page on the right Surprisingly, the fraudulent page even has a chatbot to greet clients before starting a conversation, which makes you believe that you are conversing with the banks legitimate social media page. Figure 2 Fraudulent page chat bot When clicking on any of the two chatbot options, you will receive an automatic response, followed by a question from the other side, as shown below Figure 3 Fraudulent page chat initiation After a little back-and-forth about the fraudulent transaction as shown below, the person on the other end of the line eventually asks if I am enrolled in the bank online banking service, which should be their main target in this scheme. There are however, two directions the conversation will lead If you have an online banking account, the fraudster will ask for your User ID and the last 4 digits of your account. If you dont have an online banking account, the fraudster will ask you to send a picture of the credit card. At this point, I already stopped the conversation since I didnt prepare enough tools to continue with the investigation and opted to report the pageaccount to Facebook so they can block the account and prevent other people from getting scammed. Learn more about industry trends, and how phishing kits work. Watch the Webinar Best practice and recommendation It is very convenient for banks to serve clients through social media. However, this convenience also comes with the possibility of people being deceived by threat actors, whose only aim is to steal your hard-earned money. How to avoid becoming a victim of fraudulent pages We have come up with the following check list to help people avoid becoming victims to these schemes. Look for the Facebook verification badge on the profilepage, which can also be seen on the message chat head. Figure 4 Verified Badge on the Profile Name You may also check the number of Likes the profilepage has, this usually indicates if a page was recently created. Do not provide any account information online, especially account numbers and personal information that can be used by fraudsters to login into your account. Customer service agents of banks will often make a service call once you make contact through social media channels. Never give your phone number in chats, they should be able to contact you if you provide them with a valid transaction ID. Make it a habit to call your bank directly through their customer service hotline, this will help ensure that you are talking to the right person who may help you with your account concerns. Report fraudulent pages to the social media support page to help prevent other people from falling victim to such schemes.

    "content": "**Analysis of Security Content on Fraudulent Facebook Pages**\n\nThe content discusses a phishing scheme where fraudsters create fake Facebook pages mimicking a legitimate bank to steal user credentials. Here's a detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Key Security Features**:\n   - **Verification Badges**: Highlighted as a critical feature to distinguish legitimate pages from fraudulent ones, ensuring authenticity.\n   - **Chatbots**: used by fraudsters to engage users, raising the need for user caution and awareness.\n\n2. **Compliance Certifications**:\n   - **Limited Information**: The content does not mention specific compliance standards like GDPR or PCI DSS, which could enhance trust. Adding such information would be beneficial.\n\n3. **User-Focused Security Recommendations**:\n   - **Verification Checks**: Emphasize checking for verification badges and being cautious with information sharing.\n   - **Additional Practices**: Encourage enabling two-factor authentication on social media accounts for added security.\n\n4. **Technical Security Implementation**:\n   - **Encryption and Security Protocols**: The content lacks information on encryption or protocols used by Facebook or the bank, a gap that could be addressed.\n\n5. **Data Protection Measures**:\n   - **Data Handling**: While advising against sharing sensitive info, the content doesn't discuss how the bank protects data post-collection, an area for improvement.\n\n6. **Best Practices for End Users**:\n   - **Enhanced Practices**: Suggest regular software updates, antivirus use, and providing resources on recognizing phishing attempts, possibly through linked webinars.\n\nIn conclusion, the content effectively raises awareness about phishing schemes but could be enhanced with more detailed technical, compliance, and data protection information to offer a more robust security guidance.",
