The emails are disguised as voice message notifications sent by Peach Telecom, which suggests that the campaign is targeting users in the UK. HTA files are loaded by the system using the program MSHTA.exe, and are executed by instantiating the Internet Explorer rendering engine MSHTML along with the required script engines such as jscript.dll and vbscript.dll. Opening the HTA file in a text editor shows use of the JScript language, which is used in most of the Locky campaigns. Cyren detects this downloader script variant as JSLocky.AY. Deobfuscating part of the code shows a decryption code structure similar to what we saw in the previous Locky samples we have analyzed. Each sample has at least four URLs from which it tries to download, and as usual the downloader script decrypts before executing. Similar to the variant we reported last week , the decrypted ransomware component is a DLL file and is loaded using rundll32.exe. We also observed that it no longer uses a code parameter along with the called export function. CYREN detects the decrypted DLL as W32Locky.IA. And just like the previously reported variant, this ransomware component finds and encrypts files in the affected system, renaming the files and appending the string .zepto as the file extension. Listed below are the files which are searched for and encrypted by this variant. .n64 .ltx .gif .c .lay .xltx .pdf .m4a .litesql .raw .php .ms11 Security copy .xltm .XLS .m4u .litemod .cgm .ldf .ms11 .xlsx .PPT .m3u .lbf .jpeg .mdf .sldm .xlsm .stw .mid .iwi .jpg .ibd .sldx .xlsb .sxw .wma .forge .tif .MYI .ppsm .slk .ott .flv .das .tiff .MYD .ppsx .xlw .odt .3g2 .d3dbsp .NEF .frm .ppam .xlt .DOC .mkv .bsa .psd .odb .docb .xlm .pem .3gp .bik .cmd .dbf .mml .xlc .p12 .mp4 .asset .bat .db .sxm .dif .csr .mov .apk .sh .mdb .otg .stc .crt .avi .gpg .class .sql .odg .sxc .key .asf .aes .jar .SQLITEDB .uop .ots wallet.dat .mpeg .ARC .java .SQLITE3 .potx .ods .vob .PAQ .rb .011 .potm .hwp .mpg .tar.bz2 .asp .010 .pptx .602 .wmv .tbk .cs .009 .pptm .dotm .fla .bak .brd .008 .std .dotx .swf .tar .sch .007 .sxd .docm .wav .tgz .dch .006 .pot .docx .mp3 .gz .dip .005 .pps .DOT .qcow2 .7z .pl .004 .sti .3dm .vdi .rar .vbs .003 .sxi .max .vmdk .zip .vb .002 .otp .3ds .vmx .djv .js .001 .odp .xml .wallet .djvu .h .pst .wb2 .txt .upk .svg .asm .onetoc2 .123 .CSV .sav .bmp .pas .asc .wks .uot .re4 .png .cpp .lay6 .wk1 .RTF After encrypting the files, the desktop wallpaper is replaced with the ransom instructions and the ransom instructions page is loaded. Clicking on the tor links redirects the users to the Locky decryptor page.

  "analysis": "### Comprehensive Analysis of the Security-Related Content\n\nThe content provided describes a detailed analysis of a Locky ransomware campaign detected by Cyren, including its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Below is a breakdown of the analysis into the requested categories:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Key Security Features and Their Benefits to Users**\n\nThe content highlights the following security features provided by Cyren:\n\n- **Threat Detection**: Cyren detects the Locky downloader script variant as `JSLocky.AY` and the decrypted ransomware component as `W32.Locky.IA`. This ensures users are protected from the latest ransomware variants.\n- **Sandbox Evasion Detection**: The analysis mentions Cyren's ability to detect sandbox evasion techniques, which prevents attackers from bypassing security controls.\n- **URL Filtering and Malware Blocking**: Cyren identifies malicious URLs used in the campaign, such as `hxxphotcarshhhs6632.com`, and blocks access to these domains, reducing the risk of infection.\n- **File Hash Detection**: The content lists file hashes (e.g., EML, HTA, DLL) that can be used to identify and block malicious files.\n\n**Benefits to Users**:\n- Proactive detection of ransomware variants prevents data loss and downtime.\n- Blocking malicious URLs and files reduces the risk of infection.\n- Detailed threat intelligence helps organizations improve their defenses against evolving threats.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Compliance Certifications and Regulatory Adherence**\n\nThe content does not explicitly mention compliance certifications or regulatory adherence. However, the detailed analysis and detection capabilities suggest that Cyren's solutions align with industry standards for ransomware protection, such as:\n\n- **NIST Framework**: Identifying and mitigating ransomware threats aligns with NIST's guidelines for cybersecurity.\n- **GDPR Compliance**: Protecting sensitive user data from encryption and theft supports GDPR requirements.\n- **Industry Best Practices**: The use of sandboxing, URL filtering, and file hash detection aligns with recommended security controls.\n\n**Note**: While compliance certifications are not explicitly mentioned, organizations using Cyren's solutions can likely meet regulatory requirements for data protection and incident response.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **User-Focused Security Recommendations**\n\nThe content provides implied recommendations for users:\n- **Avoid Opening Suspicious Emails**: The Locky campaign disguises itself as voice message notifications from Peach Telecom, targeting UK users. Users should be cautious when opening unsolicited emails or attachments.\n- **Verify Email Senders**: Check the sender's email address and look for red flags, such as typos or unusual domains.\n- **Use Antivirus Solutions**: Ensure endpoint protection solutions, such as Cyren, are in place to detect and block malicious files and URLs.\n- **Regular Backups**: Maintain offline backups of critical files to mitigate the impact of ransomware attacks.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Technical Security Implementation Details**\n\nThe Locky ransomware campaign employs the following techniques:\n- **HTA Files**: The ransomware is delivered as an HTML application (HTA) file, which is executed using `MSHTA.exe`. This bypasses traditional detection mechanisms.\n- **JScript Usage**: The HTA file uses JScript for its malicious operations, making it similar to previous Locky campaigns.\n- **DLL Execution**: The decrypted ransomware component is a DLL file loaded using `rundll32.exe`, which allows it to execute without additional parameters.\n- **File Encryption**: The ransomware encrypts files with extensions such as `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pdf`, and `.zip`, appending `.zepto` to encrypted files.\n- **Desktop Wallpaper Replacement**: After encryption, the ransomware replaces the desktop wallpaper with ransom instructions.\n\n**Mitigation**:\n- Block HTA files at email gateways and endpoints.\n- Monitor for unusual activity involving `MSHTA.exe` or `rundll32.exe`.\n- Use URL filtering to block access to malicious domains.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Data Protection Measures**\n\nThe content emphasizes the importance of data protection through:\n- **File Encryption**: Ransomware encrypts critical files, highlighting the need for robust backup solutions.\n- **Ransomware Detection**: Cyren's ability to detect and block Locky variants ensures data is not encrypted in the first place.\n- **Backup Solutions**: Users should implement regular, offline backups to recover data in case of an attack.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Best Practices for End Users**\n\n- **Email Safety**: Be cautious when opening emails, especially those with voice message notifications or unsolicited attachments.\n- **Verify Senders**: Always verify the identity of the sender before interacting with an email.\n- **Avoid Suspicious Links/Attachments**: Do not click on links or open attachments from unfamiliar sources.\n- **Keep Software Updated**: Ensure all software, including operating systems and antivirus, is up to date.\n- **Use Strong Antivirus**: Employ endpoint protection solutions capable of detecting ransomware threats.\n- **Regular Backups**: Perform regular backups and store them offline or in secure cloud storage.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nThe analysis highlights the sophistication of Locky ransomware and the importance of layered security defenses. Cyren's capabilities in detecting and mitigating these threats provide significant value to organizations. However, user awareness and adherence to best practices are equally critical in preventing ransomware attacks."
