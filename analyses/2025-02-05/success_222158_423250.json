The result is typically a large repository of metadata useful for making further decisions. This can include the application of a tag or label to a data object to facilitate its use and governance, either through the application of controls during its life cycle, or the activation of metadata using data fabric. By Deepti Gopal, Sema Yuce, Michael Kranawetter  Source Why Is Data Classification Important? Enhances Data Security You can think of data classification like putting labels on boxes in a storage room. By sorting our data based on how sensitive or important it is, we can make smarter choices about protecting it. For the really important stuff  like personal customer details  we can add extra locks and alarms like encryption and access controls. This way, were not just throwing a blanket security over everything were making sure that the most valuable data gets the proper treatment. Facilitates Compliance Data classification is our GPS in navigating the complexities of policies like GDPR and HIPAA. By sorting our data, it becomes much easier to see which bits need to follow which rules. Its like sorting laundry you dont wash your bright reds with your whites. Having a clear view of what sensitive data is where allows your organization to stay on the right side of the law. Improves Data Management Handling data well is key to getting things done efficiently. By classifying data, were basically organizing our digital filing cabinet, making it easier to find what we need, when we need it. This makes handling data, from storage to analysis, a smoother ride. Less clutter, less fuss.
