The difference was the verified badge on the legitimate page and the About info as shown below. Figure 1 Legitimate bank page on the left, fraudulent page on the right Surprisingly, the fraudulent page even has a chatbot to greet clients before starting a conversation, which makes you believe that you are conversing with the banks legitimate social media page. Figure 2 Fraudulent page chat bot When clicking on any of the two chatbot options, you will receive an automatic response, followed by a question from the other side, as shown below Figure 3 Fraudulent page chat initiation After a little back-and-forth about the fraudulent transaction as shown below, the person on the other end of the line eventually asks if I am enrolled in the bank online banking service, which should be their main target in this scheme.

Legitimate banks typically do not ask for such info via social media.\n   - **Recognize Common Tactics:** Fraudulent pages may use chatbots to mimic real interactions. Be cautious of unsolicited requests for sensitive information.\n\n3. **Verify Communication Through Official Channels**\n   - **Call Directly for Assistance:** Use the official customer service hotline from the bank's website to ensure you're speaking with legitimate representatives.\n   - **Be Aware of Protocol:** Legitimate customer service agents may follow up with a call after initial contact via social media.
