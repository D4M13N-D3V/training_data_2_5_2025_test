The organizations users received a notification about a newly arrived secure message, complete with an expiration date to create a sense of urgency to review the content. To view the secure message, the potential victim had to click on the Open Message button. Once the button is clicked, the user would be immediately redirected to the next stage of phishing attack and continued along this fraud journey.
