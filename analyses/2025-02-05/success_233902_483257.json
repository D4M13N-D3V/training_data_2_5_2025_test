This versatile keylogger malware is being delivered as an attachment to phony bank transfer emails, which inform the recipient that they have received a deposit. The emails are originating primarily from bots in the U.S. and Singapore, and are branded as coming from several different banks, including Emirates NDB and DBS see example below. The email subjects are typically financial transfer-related, including Online wire transfer payment notification Payment update Swift copy The attachments are all named with variations of Swift including swift copy_pdf.ace swift copy.zip swift_copy.pdf.gz Swift here refers to SWIFT codes, used to uniquely identify banks and financial institutions globally for fund transfers, and is evidently used to give the impression that these are genuine interbank transaction reports. The email attachment is an executable file, most typically with PDF in the filename Swift_Copy.Pdf.exe. Cyren researchers report that after execution it deletes itself and creates a file called filename.vbs in the Windows startup folder. Every time the victim restarts or logs into his or her PC after signing out, this script runs, executing the malware itself  filename.exe located in AppDataLocalTempsubfolder. The malware queries the registry for passwords and other sensitive information related to many kinds of software. It especially focuses on FTP and web browsing software and other software that could have credential information. It gathers information from all the web browsers on the computer stored passwords and usernames, history, cookies, cache etc. and email clients as well. The malware also searches the computer for crypto-currency wallets to steal. Among the wallets it tries to find Anoncoin, BBQcoin, Bitcoin, Bytecoin, Craftcoin, Devcoin, Digitalcoin, Fastcoin, Feathercoin, Florincoin, Freicoin, I0coin, Infinitecoin, Ixcoin, Junkcoin, Litecoin, Luckycoin, Megacoin, Mincoin, Namecoin, Phoenixcoin, Primecoin, Quarkcoin, Tagcoin, Terracoin, Worldcoin, Yacoin, and Zetacoin. The malware creates hooks for both the keyboard and the mouse. The API windows call GetAsyncKeyState is called which indicates that the malware is logging every keystroke Keylogger.

    "content": "**Analysis of Malware Outbreak Content: Security Features, Compliance, and User Guidance**\n\n**1. Key Security Features and Their Benefits**\n\n- **Email Filtering and Malware Detection:** The content highlights Cyren's role in detecting the outbreak, indicating their security solutions include robust email filtering and malware detection. These features help block phishing emails and identify malicious attachments, protecting users from initial infection.\n\n- **Cloud-Based Security Services:** Cyren offers cloud-based email and web security, providing an additional layer of protection against phishing and malware. These services are beneficial for detecting and mitigating threats in real-time.\n\n**2. Compliance Certifications and Regulatory Adherence**\n\n- While the content does not explicitly mention certifications like ISO 27001 or GDPR compliance, companies using Cyren's services may infer adherence to such standards. Including compliance information would enhance transparency and assure users of data protection alignment with global regulations.\n\n**3. User-Focused Security Recommendations**\n\n- **Phishing Education:** Educate users to recognize phishing attempts, emphasizing caution with email attachments and verification of senders before opening.\n\n- **Software Updates:** Regularly update software to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Data Backups:** Implement regular backups to mitigate potential data loss from malware attacks.\n\n- **Antivirus Use:** Utilize reputable antivirus software to detect and remove threats.\n\n**4. Technical Security Implementation Details**\n\n- **Malware Operation:** The malware uses VBS scripts for persistence, located in the startup folder, ensuring execution on restart. It resides in the AppData/Local/Temp folder, mimicking legitimate files to evade detection.\n\n- **Executable Disguise:** Attachments appear as PDFs (e.g., \"Swift_Copy.Pdf.exe\") to trick users into execution.\n\n- **Credential and Data Theft:** Targets credentials from browsers, email clients, and over 20 cryptocurrency wallets, using keylogging via GetAsyncKeyState API.\n\n**5. Data Protection Measures**\n\n- **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to protect against unauthorized access.\n\n- **Secure Credential Storage:** Use encrypted vaults for credentials and implement MFA to add a security layer beyond passwords.\n\n**6. Best Practices for End Users**\n\n- **Vigilance:** Avoid suspicious emails, links, and attachments. Verify senders' identities before engaging.\n\n- **System Updates:** Regularly update software to patch vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Security Software:** Install and update antivirus software to detect threats.\n\n- **Account Monitoring:** Regularly check for unauthorized access and unfamiliar transactions.\n\n- **Security Training:** Engage in training to reinforce safe computing practices.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis underscores the importance of multi-layered security approaches, user education, and robust technical measures. Addressing gaps, such as explicitly mentioning encryption and MFA, would enhance the content's comprehensiveness. By adhering to these guidelines, both organizations and users can significantly enhance their security posture against evolving threats.",
