Advanced Threat Protection , Microsoft Defender for Office 365 that helps protect from users clicking on malicious URLs in emails. This feature provides URL scanning as well as rewriting of inbound emails within the mail flow, and time-of-click URL and link verification. Safe Links scans on top of regular anti-spam and anti-malware solutions and works to protect your organization from malicious phishing links. Spend less time investigating suspicious messages and remediating threats. Download the Report How Do Safe Links Work? Safe Links begin by analyzing non-whitelisted links from known malicious sites. If URLs are identified as potentially suspicious, you may be blocked from opening that URL when you click on it. Instead of going to the site, you will see a warning page first. Its much easier to explain Safe Links and URL rewriting with examples and diagrams. Lets use three URLs from an imaginary email message A safe website  www.amazon.com Lets pretend this is a well-known phishing site www.Phishing-R-Us.com Well use this as a new, uncategorized website  www.o365-shop.com Safe Links rewrites the above URLs a format similar to these na01.safelinks.protection.com?urlwww.amazon.com na01.safelinks.protection.com?urlwww.phishing-r-us.com na01.safelinks.protection.com?urlwww.o365-shop.com Due to the magic of HTML, Microsoft ATP can rewrite URLs without changing how theyre displayed to the users. For the most part, users only know if ATP has written a URL if they click and watch the location bar in their browsers. Figure 1 A Safe Links URL in the browser location bar When a user clicks one of these rewritten URLs, they are first directed to the na01.safelinks.protection.com server which checks if the destination URL, defined in the portion of the URL after the equal sign, is safe or a threat. If the URL is safe, the user is redirected to the destination as though nothing ever happened  although there is often a noticeable delay. If the URL is a threat, the user is redirected to a warning page instead of the intended destination. Figure 2 Safe Links blocking access to a phishing page The intent of URL rewriting is to provide something called time of click protection. Its a belt and suspenders approach to applying static threat databases to defend against phishing. If the URL isnt known to be a threat at the time its scanned prior to delivery then URL rewriting allows the email security server to check again when a user clicks the URL. However, there are a few problems with this approach URL rewriting cannot be applied to URLs in files attached to a message or files shared from, for example, Google Drive. Attackers know this and Cyren has observed a big increase in the number of phishing URLs contained in files. Since the display name of the URL isnt rewritten, users can simply copy that text and paste it into a browser. I do this all the time to skip the delay associated with the email security server. Security is only as effective as your threat intelligence. Weve found the best way to identify zero-day and targeted phishing URLs is to analyze them in real-time. URL rewriting can break the association of URLs and apps on your phone. I just ran into this when trying to reset the password for a mobile app using a reset link delivered to my inbox. URL rewriting is reactive, so administrators still need to respond to threats. Really what you need is a system that not only continuously detects phishing threats as they evolve but can also automatically remediate all the affected messages.
