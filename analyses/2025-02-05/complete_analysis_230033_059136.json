      "user_guidance": "### Security Guidance for End Users: Data Security and Protection\n\nHere are practical and easy-to-follow recommendations to help you protect yourself and your organization from potential security threats:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Security Best Practices**\n   - **Verify Email Sources**: Always double-check the sender\u2019s email address and look for any red flags, such as spelling mistakes or unusual domains, before opening attachments or clicking on links.\n   - **Be Cautious with Attachments**: Avoid opening attachments from unknown or untrusted sources, especially password-protected files, as they could be malicious.\n   - **Use Strong Passwords**: If you must use passwords for files or accounts, use unique, complex passwords and store them securely in a password manager.\n   - **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Protect your email and cloud accounts with 2FA to add an extra layer of security.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Data Protection Recommendations**\n   - **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use encryption for sensitive files or data before sharing them. Tools like Microsoft Office\u2019s built-in encryption or third-party encryption software can help.\n   - **Backup Regularly**: Keep backups of important files in secure, encrypted storage solutions, like external drives or cloud storage platforms.\n   - **Limit File Sharing**: Only share files with trusted individuals and use secure methods, such as encrypted email or secure file-sharing platforms.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Safe Usage Guidelines**\n   - **Avoid Opening Suspicious Files**: If an email attachment (like an Excel file) seems unexpected or unusual, do not open it. Contact the sender to verify its legitimacy.\n   - **Use Antivirus Software**: Install and regularly update antivirus software to scan attachments and files before opening them.\n   - **Educate Yourself**: Stay informed about common phishing and social engineering tactics to avoid falling victim to scams.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n   - **Phishing Attacks**: Be suspicious of emails asking for sensitive information or login credentials. Legitimate organizations will not ask for passwords via email.\n   - **Password-Protected Files**: Be wary of password-protected files from unknown sources. Some files may appear encrypted but are not truly secure.\n   - **Malware**: Never download or open files from untrusted sources, as they may contain malware or ransomware.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Privacy Protection Measures**\n   - **Limit Personal Information Sharing**: Avoid sharing sensitive personal or company information via email or unsecured channels.\n   - **Use Encryption Tools**: Use end-to-end encrypted communication tools (e.g., Signal, WhatsApp) for sharing sensitive information.\n   - **Monitor Accounts**: Regularly check your email, cloud storage, and other accounts for unauthorized access or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n   - **Suspicious Files or Emails**: If you receive a suspicious file or email, report it to your IT or security team immediately. Do not open or interact with it further.\n   - **Data Breach Concerns**: If you suspect your data has been exposed or compromised, contact your organization\u2019s security team or a professional cybersecurity expert.\n   - **Complex Protection Needs**: If you need to protect highly sensitive data or set up encryption, consult with a cybersecurity professional to ensure proper implementation.\n\n---\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to security threats and protect your data effectively.
