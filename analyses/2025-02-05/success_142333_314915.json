Ransomware tactics are evolving, deploying increasingly sophisticated and human approaches. And, theyre profitable. On average, 47 of enterprises pay the ransom, making ransomware a lucrative criminal industry. Yet, the actual cost of a ransomware attack does not come from the ransom itself, but from the sudden, disruptive business impact the attack creates. Ransomware is a malicious software originally designed to identify vulnerabilities in a network. Created to do no harm, ransomware evolved into a tool for fraudsters seeking easy sources of revenue. Ransomware helps cyber criminals generate income by blackmailing the victim and demanding them to pay for data recovery. Ransomware has transformed from its beginnings of automatic attacks into human-operated, targeted campaigns with sophisticated strategies. Gartner forecasts that 75 of IT organizations experience an attack by 2025.
