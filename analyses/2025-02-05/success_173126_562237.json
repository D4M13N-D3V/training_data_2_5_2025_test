Adobe Spark Phishing Breaking It Down In recent days, the phishing pages linked from Adobe Spark vary from generic proposal documents to more specific POST COVID-19 proposal requests. They use existing business nameslogos or something entirely made up but with fancy illustrations as a way to have prospective victims think that the document theyre about to view is from a trustworthy source. As evident in the image above, these phishing pages have some specific detail which attempts to pique your interest and propel you to go further and view the document. The NOTE text on the image below has been observed to be common on POST COVID-19 business proposal request pages, and the only differences are in the entity or individual name purporting to be the sender These pages often have some Request For Proposal RFP bid ID as an added touch to make it seem more authentic. There are Review Document andor Download Document buttons that, when clicked, will open a new tab page that aims to obtain your login credentials. Theyre designed to make you input your password twice to make it seem like you just had a typing error in your password.
