The first Yuletide-related malware campaign has already been spotted. Theres always an expected and monumental amount of consumer spam and phishing in the run-up to Black Friday and then Christmas itself, but weve found one malware author getting into the Christmas spirit in late October by targeting backdoor-delivering emails at the Yuletide supply chain, specifically Christmas goods suppliers whose preparations for the year-end commercial convulsion are well underway. According to the National Retail Federation, for some retailers the holiday season can represent as much as 30 percent of annual sales, and goods manufacturers and wholesalers in general are keen to take advantage, not to mention seasonal merchandise suppliers. Fileless Malware from Known Author The email being sent for this campaign Figure 1 uses the subject line Christmas Order with a made-up reference number, and proceeds to ask for pricing and delivery terms for items allegedly listed in an attachment, with the admonition that delivery is needed by November 20 th . This last detail is a classic social engineering tactic, intending to give a sense of urgency to the recipient. Opening the apparently .doc attachment, the user is asked to double-click an icon in order to view the contents. In doing so, a standard Windows security warning appears about running unverified software, and, unfortunately for those who ignore the warning, proceeding further detonates a RAR SFX self-extracting archive, which runs a first-level AutoIt Script Loader Module. This in turn is used to decode and load a second-level payload. A step-by-step analysis of the deployment sequence is provided further below. The final executable payload is a variant of the NetwiredRC backdoor. This payload uses the same custom Caesar Cipher and key used in a variant we recognized, as we covered it in one of our blog articles earlier this year , so it is safe to assume that the same culprit is behind this attack wave. Once installed, the backdoor has many capabilities, including but not limited to logging key strokes, stealing cookied login credentials stored in multiple browsers, and stealing email login credentials. Since the entire installation sequence is injected to a target process and is not saved to disk, it can be classified as a fileless malware. Fileless malware is a technique that has been a growing topic in security circles, and according to Cyren detection stats there has been a 350 percent increase in its use since 2016. Even though its a bit of a misnomer and not actually literally fileless, and is overhyped as undetectable, it is part of a general trend in increasing malware evasiveness. Although fileless methods have a lengthy history, its appearing more now because detection methods have been catching up with other techniques, application whitelisting wont stop it, and it makes attribution more difficult. If you need a good overview on fileless malware, we recommend this recorded webinar from a colleague of ours, which looks at the concept applied to ransomware, but the techniques described apply to malware generally, or this blog , which summarizes the concept. Figure 1 Email soliciting proposals Figure 2 Bait document that induces a click Supply Chain Hack Target Isnt Necessarily You The target of the email would appear to be smaller potential suppliers, but keep well in mind that that isnt necessarily the ultimate target. The massive 2014 hack into Home Depot resulting in 56 million stolen credit and debit card details and 53 million stolen email addresses, was credited to inadequate security at a small third-party vendor, as were the more recent hacks into Amazon Web Services and Wendys, as well as last Julys massive car manufacturers data leak . A 2017 study by the Ponemon Institute, found that 56 of large breaches were the result of an initial breach into a third-party vendor, possible because many smaller suppliers are often granted access to their customers corporate data and even network login credentials. Another well-known manufacturing industry example was examined here. How it Works Self-extracting RAR Archive As alluded to above, the loaded software is actually a RAR SFX, which contains several files having random filenames. Viewing the contents, we can see the files along with the SFX description and configuration settings Figure 3 Self-extracting archive with variable settings highlighted Highlighted in the screenshot are the variable settings for the self-extraction process UpdateU7WS52 Pathtemp42057438 Setupjsr.exe cecrmq The Path variable tells the SFX to extract the archive contents into the folder temp42057438 , while the Setup variable auto-executes the file jsr.exe , with the argument cec-rmq . The auto-executed file, jsr.exe , in this case is a copy of the AutoIt stand-alone script interpreter, which loads the file cec-rmq, which is a malicious AutoIt script. To make the AutoIt script difficult to read, cecrmq is filled with a lot of comments, which in this case could be considered as plain garbage. Once the garbage is cleaned up, we can see that the actual code is just around 70 lines. Figure 4 Comparative screenshots, showing script after removal of obfuscating garbage code First Level Script AutoIt Script Loader Module The first level script is a loader module, which is used to decode and load a 2 nd level payload, summarized as follows 1. Upon execution of the AutoIt script, cecrmq , it searches for a file named qch.pdf , which upon further inspection is actually a configuration INI file containing several variables used by the malicious script. The configuration file also includes two 2 pieces of encoded data, which are decoded at run-time. Shown below is a snippet of the cleaned up configuration file. 2. The first piece of encoded data, marked by sData and esData, is decrypted by the script using an arbitrary shellcode embedded in the script. This arbitrary shellcode is an ARC4-based decryption algorithm, loaded by the script using the CallWindowProc API. The cipher key, 869, used in the decryption process is read by the script from the sK variable in the configuration file. 3. The decrypted data, which is another AutoIt script, is updated to replace the string  Settings File Name  to the file name of the configuration file  qch.pdf  before saving it to a randomly named file in the same directory as itself and executing it afterwards with the AutoIt interpreter  jsr.exe  as shown in the code snippet below. AutoIt Script Payload Deletes Itself When Done The decrypted script is responsible for the actual malicious behavior which could be summarized as follows 1. For persistence, it creates an Auto-Start registry entry for jsr.exe and cecrmq, to ensure that its loader module automatically runs even after the system is restarted. 2. Decrypts the second piece of encoded data from the configuration file marked by Data and eData with ARC2 decryption algorithm using the ADVAPI32 APIs. The cipher key, nkk , is fetched from the Keys variable in the configuration file. 3. The script then searches for a target host executable, where the malicious payload will be injected. If Microsoft .NET Framework is installed in the system, the script would choose RegSvcs.exe as its host and will fallback to the default web browser if neither v2.0.50727 or v4.0.30319 is found in the system. Additionally, if the variable eos is set in the configuration file, the script runs a copy of the target host executable in the Windows temporary directory using either RegSvcs.exe or firefox.exe as the file name. 4. Using an arbitrary shellcode embedded in the script, the target host executable is run in suspended mode where the malicious payload executable is then injected and executed, via the CallWindowProcW API. Finally, after performing all needed operations, the script deletes itself to hide its presence in the system.

    "content": "### Security Guidance for Data Protection and Safe Practices\n\nGiven the increasing sophistication and stealth of cyber threats like fileless malware, it\u2019s crucial to adopt practical security measures to protect your organization and personal data. Below are clear, easy-to-follow security recommendations based on the content provided:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Security Best Practices**\n- **Be Cautious with Email Attachments and Links:**\n  - Avoid opening unsolicited email attachments, especially those from unfamiliar senders or with urgent language (e.g., \"Your account will be closed if you don\u2019t act now\").\n  - Verify the sender\u2019s identity and check for typos or unusual formatting in the email.\n  - Hover over links to see the destination URL before clicking.\n\n- **Avoid Executing Untrusted Files:**\n  - Never double-click or execute files from untrusted sources, especially those downloaded from emails or the internet.\n  - If a file triggers a security warning, do not ignore it\u2014cancel the operation immediately.\n\n- **Use Strong Antivirus and Endpoint Protection:**\n  - Ensure all devices are equipped with up-to-date antivirus software and endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools. Fileless malware often bypasses traditional signature-based detection, so behavior-based detection is critical.\n\n- **Enable Windows Security Features:**\n  - Turn on Windows Defender, ensure real-time protection is active, and enable features like Tamper Protection.\n  - Use User Account Control (UAC) to prompt for admin privileges before executing high-risk operations.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Back Up Your Data Regularly:**\n  - Perform regular backups of critical data and store them offline or in secure cloud storage.\n  - Test your backups periodically to ensure they can be restored.\n\n- **Use Encryption:**\n  - Encrypt sensitive files and communications to prevent unauthorized access in case of a breach.\n  - Use secure channels (e.g., S/MIME for emails or encrypted messaging apps) when sharing confidential information.\n\n- **Segment Network Access:**\n  - Limit access to sensitive data and systems to only those who absolutely need it.\n  - Use virtual private networks (VPNs) for remote access to internal resources.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Educate Users About Social Engineering:**\n  - Train employees to recognize phishing attempts, including emails that create a sense of urgency or appear to be from legitimate business partners.\n  - Conduct regular security awareness training to address emerging threats.\n\n- **Avoid Overprivileged Accounts:**\n  - Use standard user accounts for daily tasks instead of administrator accounts to reduce the impact of potential exploitation.\n\n- **Monitor System Behavior:**\n  - Keep an eye out for unusual system behavior, such as unexplained slowdowns, unfamiliar processes, or unexpected pop-ups.\n  - Report any suspicious activity to your IT or security team immediately.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Fileless Malware:**\n  - Fileless malware operates in memory and can evade traditional detection methods. Use advanced endpoint protection tools that monitor for abnormal system behavior.\n  - Restrict the execution of scripts (e.g., AutoIt, PowerShell) unless they are explicitly needed for business operations.\n\n- **Supply Chain Risks:**\n  - Small suppliers are often targeted as entry points for larger attacks. Ensure all third-party vendors follow security best practices and have adequate protections in place.\n  - Monitor for breaches in third-party services and be prepared to disconnect or revoke access if needed.\n\n- **Credential Theft:**\n  - Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.\n  - Regularly update and rotate credentials, especially for critical systems.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Limit Data Sharing:**\n  - Only share personal or business data with trusted partners and ensure they have strong security measures in place.\n  - Use data loss prevention (DLP) tools to monitor and control sensitive data sharing.\n\n- **Secure Communication Channels:**\n  - Avoid discussing sensitive business or personal information over unsecured channels like plaintext emails or public Wi-Fi.\n\n- **Reduce Digital Footprint:**\n  - Avoid posting sensitive information about your organization or supply chain publicly, as attackers often use open-source intelligence (OSINT) to plan attacks.\n\n---\n\n### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- If your organization experiences any of the following, seek professional assistance immediately:\n  - Unexplained system behavior or performance issues.\n  - Signs of unauthorized access (e.g., unknown login attempts, account lockouts, or unsolicited password reset requests).\n  - Discovery of malicious files or scripts on your network.\n  - Requests for ransom or evidence of data leaks.\n- Contact a cybersecurity expert or your IT provider if you are unsure about how to handle a potential threat or incident.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n- Stay vigilant about suspicious emails and attachments.\n- Use advanced security tools and keep them updated.\n- Educate users about social engineering and fileless malware risks.\n- Regularly back up critical data and test restore processes.\n- Limit access to sensitive resources and monitor for unusual activity.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to fileless malware and other cyber threats.",
