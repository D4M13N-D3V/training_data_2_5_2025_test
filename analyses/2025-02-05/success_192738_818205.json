From their perch powering 600,000 enterprises cloud inboxes in the United States alone, they report Malware attacks are decreasing. Instead 70 of attacks are through phishing emails, largely to harvest credentials. Attackers are laying long-term traps that scour the internet looking for systems and Internet of Things IoT devices that are vulnerable to ransomware. Cybercriminals are taking advantage of national holidays to attack systems when SecOps resources are thinnest. Related Microsoft Finally Acknowledges COVID-19-Related Cybercrimes In total, 73 of CISOs reported their organizations leaked sensitive data in the last 12 months. Even the savviest targets are struggling to cope with attacks that rapidly morph across sending domains, email addresses, content templates and URL domains. The goal is to increase the combination of variations to remain unseen. The lone bright spot? The number of Covid-themed attacks has fallen sharply since April 2020. Fewer everyday consumers are being targeted but nation-states are increasingly attacking the academic, governmental, and commercial groups involved in vaccine research.

    "content": "### Security Advisory Report: Practical Guidance on Data Security and Protection\n\nIn light of the evolving cyber threats highlighted by Microsoft's Digital Defense Report and other sources, it is crucial to adopt a proactive and layered approach to security. Below is a comprehensive guide to help individuals and organizations protect themselves against common security risks:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Security Best Practices**\n- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Require MFA for all critical accounts, especially email, cloud services, and financial platforms.\n- **Regularly Update Software and Systems:** Keep all operating systems, applications, and devices up to date to patch vulnerabilities.\n- **Conduct Security Awareness Training:** Train employees to recognize phishing attempts, suspicious emails, and other social engineering tactics.\n- **Use Strong, Unique Passwords:** Avoid reusing passwords across accounts. Use a password manager to securely store complex passwords.\n- **Monitor Account Activity:** Regularly review bank statements, email inboxes, and cloud storage for unauthorized activity.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n- **Backup Data Regularly:** Implement automated, encrypted backups for critical data and ensure backups are stored securely (e.g., offline or in a separate cloud service).\n- **Encrypt Sensitive Data:** Use encryption for sensitive information both in transit (e.g., HTTPS) and at rest (e.g., encrypted files or databases).\n- **Limit Data Access:** Restrict access to sensitive data to only those who need it. Use role-based access controls to enforce this.\n- **Use Secure Communication Tools:** Avoid sending sensitive information via unsecured channels like SMS or personal email. Use encrypted messaging apps or VPNs when necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n- **Be Cautious with Emails:** Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unfamiliar senders. Verify the sender\u2019s identity before responding to requests for sensitive information.\n- **Use Public Wi-Fi with Caution:** Avoid accessing sensitive accounts or entering personal information when using public Wi-Fi. Use a VPN to encrypt your connection.\n- **Think Before You Click:** Hover over links to preview the URL and verify it is legitimate. Watch for spelling mistakes or unusual domains.\n- **Monitor Your Accounts Daily:** Check your financial accounts, email, and other online accounts regularly for signs of unauthorized activity.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n- **Phishing Attacks:** Cybercriminals use deceptive emails, websites, or messages to steal credentials or install malware. \n  - **Prevention:** Educate users to recognize phishing signs (e.g., urgent language, typos, or unsolicited requests).\n  - **Use Tools:** Deploy email security solutions that scan for phishing attempts.\n  \n- **Ransomware Attacks:** Malware that encrypts your data until a ransom is paid.\n  - **Prevention:** Regularly back up data, avoid downloading files from untrusted sources, and ensure systems are patched.\n\n- **Credential Theft:** Attackers often steal credentials to gain access to accounts or systems.\n  - **Prevention:** Use MFA, avoid reusing passwords, and monitor accounts for unauthorized login attempts.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n- **Enable Privacy Settings:** Adjust privacy settings on social media and online accounts to limit the sharing of personal information.\n- **Avoid Oversharing Online:** Be cautious about posting sensitive details like addresses, phone numbers, or travel plans publicly.\n- **Use a VPN:** Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can protect your data when using public Wi-Fi or accessing sensitive information online.\n- **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Turn off location services, cameras, or microphones on devices when not in use.\n\n---\n\n### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n- **During an Active Attack:** If you suspect a breach or ransomware attack, immediately disconnect from the internet and contact IT or cybersecurity professionals.\n- **After a Data Breach:** If your data has been exposed, monitor your accounts, change passwords, and consider credit monitoring services.\n- **For Outdated Systems:** If your organization is using outdated software or hardware, consult with security experts to modernize your systems.\n- **For Advanced Threats:** If targeted by sophisticated attacks (e.g., nation-state actors), seek assistance from cybersecurity firms or specialized consultants.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Note: Community and Partnership**\nAs emphasized in the Microsoft report, cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. Collaboration between individuals, organizations, and governments is essential to address the growing sophistication of cyber threats. By staying informed and taking proactive steps, we can all contribute to a safer digital environment.\n\nIf you need additional support or advanced security tools, consider partnering with providers like **Cyren Inbox Security**, which offers automated email scanning, incident management, and threat detection services.\n\n---\n\nStay vigilant, stay secure!",
