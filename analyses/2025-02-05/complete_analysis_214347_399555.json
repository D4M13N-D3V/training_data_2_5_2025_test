April 20, 2020 Dear Educators, So, this is the New Normal that everyone has been talking about  a time in which peak internet traffic is up over 45. Millions of US students have abruptly made the switch to remote learning in the past weeks, and with this brings a magnitude of unanticipated data growth as communication between staff and students transitions to strictly digital. In the United States, of 1720 educators surveyed , 81 interact with students on a weekly basis or more often. Email is the most prevalent form of communication, with 86 indicating that is their most common method. Other approaches such as message boards 69, and conferencing platforms 58 are also experiencing high use. So how has data compliance changed under the new normal? The US Department of Education published guidelines outlining changes to the educational landscape, however, one thing that has not changed is the protection of faculty and students privacy. Data privacy in the education system still garners great concern. There has been no data privacy related changes or exceptions made due to the rapid onset of remote learning. Schools are still required to take full ownership over any online communication. There are a variety of different laws that can be, and still are, applicable to an educational institute Federal, such as FERPA and State, such as SOPIPA . International, such as GDPR . Because all facultystaff related communications are digital based, institutes are now responsible for protecting more data than ever before.

This ensures that all data is retained securely and can be accessed as needed.\n- **Scalability and Affordability**: The product is designed to be scalable, allowing educational institutions to handle increasing data volumes without overhauling their existing systems. The pricing model ($1,000/year with the first 3 months free) is attractive, especially for budget-conscious educational institutions.\n- **Rapid Deployment**: The solution can be set up quickly, which is critical for schools facing immediate storage and compliance challenges.\n\n**Benefits**:\n- Ensures continuity of communication without data loss.\n- Provides a cost-effective solution for managing data growth.\n- Offers flexibility to use additional storage without migrating entire systems.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Compliance Certifications and Regulatory Adherence**\n\nThe content references several key regulations applicable to educational institutions:\n- **FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)**: Protects the privacy of student education records.\n- **SOPIPA (Student Online Personal Information Protection Act)**: Regulates the collection, use, and disclosure of student data by educational technology providers.\n- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: Applies to international data protection standards, relevant for institutions interacting with students or staff in the EU.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The content emphasizes that data privacy laws have not been relaxed, even with the shift to remote learning. Schools are still fully responsible for protecting faculty and student data.\n- While the content mentions these regulations, it does not explicitly state which compliance certifications Data443 holds (e.g., GDPR compliance, FERPA certification). This omission could leave readers questioning the product's adherence to these standards.\n\n**Recommendation**: Explicitly list compliance certifications and provide assurance of adherence to FERPA, SOPIPA, and GDPR.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **User-Focused Security Recommendations**\n\nThe content indirectly provides guidance for users by highlighting the importance of:\n- Implementing solutions like ArcMail for Education to archives all digital communications securely.\n- Understanding that schools are fully responsible for protecting faculty and student data, even in a remote learning environment.\n\n**Additional Recommendations**:\n- **Educate Staff and Students**: Provide training on data privacy best practices, such as avoiding sensitive information in unsecured communications.\n- **Monitor Data Access**: Ensure that only authorized personnel can access archived communications.\n- **Regular Audits**: Conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance with data protection regulations.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Technical Security Implementation Details**\n\nThe content does not provide detailed technical information about the security implementation of ArcMail for Education. However, it does mention:\n- **Cloud-Based Solution**: The product is cloud-based, which implies scalability and accessibility.\n- **Rapid Deployment**: The solution can be set up quickly, suggesting minimal disruption to existing systems.\n- **Pay-As-You-Go Pricing**: Institutions only pay for the additional storage they need, which aligns with the solution's scalability.\n\n**Gap in Content**:\n- Technical details such as encryption methods, access controls, and integration with existing systems (e.g., compatibility with specific email platforms) are missing. These details are crucial for IT departments evaluating the solution.\n\n**Recommendation**: Provide more technical specifications, such as encryption standards (e.g., AES-256), compliance with industry security frameworks (e.g., NIST), and compatibility with popular email platforms.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Data Protection Measures**\n\nThe content implies that ArcMail for Education provides secure archiving of communications, but it does not explicitly outline the data protection measures in place. Key measures that can be inferred or expected include:\n- **Data Retention and Archiving**: Secure storage of all digital communications to ensure compliance with retention requirements.\n- **Access Controls**: Ensuring that only authorized personnel can access archived data.\n- **Encryption**: Protecting data at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n**Gap in Content**:\n- Specific details about data protection measures, such as encryption protocols, backup processes, and disaster recovery plans, are not provided.\n\n**Recommendation**: Clearly outline the data protection measures, including encryption, access controls, and redundancy, to reassure users of the solution's security.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Best Practices for End Users**\n\nThe content encourages educational institutions to adopt ArcMail for Education to manage communication data securely.

However, it lacks specific details on technical implementation, compliance certifications, and best practices for end users. To improve, Data443 should:\n1. Explicitly state compliance certifications (e.g., FERPA, GDPR).\n2. Provide technical details, such as encryption methods and system compatibility.\n3. Offer actionable security recommendations for end users.\n4. Highlight specific data protection measures, such as encryption and access controls.\n\nBy addressing these gaps, the content will better meet the needs of educators and IT professionals evaluating the solution.",
