The Russian invasion of Ukraine is no exception. Over the past two weeks, the Cyren research team has seen a huge increase in crypto scams taking advantage of the countrys political unrest. Ukraine has received more than 50 million in crypto donations since the war started, with the majority of donations resulting from the Ukraine government twitter account requesting Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether and Polkadot. So, its not surprising that cybercriminals are focusing on crypto donations to trick victims. The team has discovered an endless wave of email scam messages with subject lines including Help Ukraine, Help Ukraine war victims and Help Ukraine stop the war!  humanitarian fund raising. While the victims are under the impression that they are helping Ukraine, the donation is going straight into a scammers wallet. In the last few days, the research team has uncovered more than 100k emails per day. Over 50 of the emails are being routed through the US, however, this is not an indication that the emails originated in the US. The research team found emails coming from all over the globe, including Indonesia, Brazil, India, South Africa and Colombia. As expected, a large number of the emails are sent from spoofed addresses with domain endings related to Ukraine to increase their authenticity. However, a significant number of emails are being sent from random Gmail addresses, highlighting the arrogance of cybercriminals who prey on trusting victims.

The research team is also seeing fake donation scams proliferate Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.
