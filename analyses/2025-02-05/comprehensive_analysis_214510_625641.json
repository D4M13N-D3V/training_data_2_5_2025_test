Data443 or the Company OTCPK ATDS, a leading data security and privacy software company, today announced that its privacy and data discovery platforms continue to provide market leadership, evidenced by the engagement time by one of the largest domestic wholesale electric energy providers. This new engagement is yet another victory for Data443 in a recent string of similar agreements, expanding the Companys revenue base and adding to the bottom line. Jason Remillard, Founder and CEO of Data443, commented, This multi-year agreement once again continues to solidify our foothold in critical industries such as energy, government, and financial services. In addition to delivering our unmatched retention management and classification protocols, this industry leader will benefit from significantly more efficient, cost-effective, and timely data migrations. Our analysis, based on the hundreds of regular engagements and documents within this organization, should reduce their data footprint by close to 50 overall, with commensurate risk factors as well.
