GDPR is a regulation which applies to anyone doing business in or with Europe. If you process the personal information of EU subjects you need to comply. The introduction of GDPR has forced organisations of all sizes to re-think their data governance processes, which is generating a renewed interest in email archiving. Three months on from enforcement date  what has happened? In the lead-up to GDPR enforcement in May 2018, new businesses and categories of technology to help organisations comply with the regulation appeared. Vendors quickly re-positioned their products and services to demonstrate how they could help. The upshot of this flurry of activity was heightened awareness of GDPR amongst many people, whether they had a vested business interest or not. Fast forward to present day and many of these highly aware individuals have become a headache for businesses  they know their rights and are exercising them. According to the Financial Times, Facebook has seen a three or fourfold increase in the number of subject access requests SAR and Marriott, the hotel operator, has asked for an extension of the SAR response window, to enable it to cope with the volumes. The same article highlights the trend for tools and even apps that allow individuals to easily submit SARs. What appears to be top of mind for many organisations is how they can respond in a timely manner to the requests they are receiving from these newly aware individuals. Here is what you need to know and how Cyren can help.

      "user_guidance": "**Comprehensive Data Security and Protection Guidance**\n\nIn light of the GDPR and the increasing importance of email archiving, we have compiled a structured approach to data security and protection. This guidance is designed to be practical and easy to follow, ensuring compliance and peace of mind.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Security Best Practices\n\n- **Encryption**: Always encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to protect against unauthorized access.\n- **Backups**: Regularly back up critical data and store copies offsite or in the cloud for disaster recovery.\n- **Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords and consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an added layer of security.\n- **Access Controls**: Limit access to data based on the principle of least privilege to reduce potential breaches.\n\n### 2. Data Protection Recommendations\n\n- **Data Minimization**: Collect and retain only the data necessary for business operations.\n- **Data Location Awareness**: Maintain a clear understanding of where your data is stored to ensure compliance and quick access for audits.\n- **Retention Policies**: Establish clear policies on data retention and disposal to avoid keeping data longer than necessary.\n- **Email Archiving Tools**: Utilize solutions like Cyren for secure archiving, enabling efficient searches and compliance with GDPR requirements.\n\n### 3. Safe Usage Guidelines\n\n- **Employee Training**: Conduct regular training sessions on data security and phishing to foster a culture of awareness.\n- **Phishing Prevention**: Educate users on recognizing phishing attempts and the importance of verifying sources before clicking links or sharing data.\n- **Secure Communication**: Use encrypted channels for sensitive communications to safeguard against intercepts.\n- **Account Monitoring**: Encourage users to monitor their accounts for suspicious activities and report any anomalies promptly.\n\n### 4. Common Security Risks and Prevention\n\n- **Insider Threats**: Implement access controls and monitor user activity to mitigate risks from within.\n- **Data Breaches**: Use encryption and firewalls to prevent unauthorized access. Have an incident response plan ready.\n- **Phishing Attacks**: Train employees to spot phishing emails and deploy email filters to block malicious content.\n- **Unencrypted Data**: Always encrypt data to prevent exposure and ensure confidentiality.\n\n### 5. Privacy Protection Measures\n\n- **Confidentiality**: Handle personal data with care, ensuring access is restricted to necessary personnel.\n- **SAR Efficiency**: Streamline processes to respond quickly to Subject Access Requests, using tools like Cyren for efficient data retrieval.\n- **Anonymization**: Consider anonymizing data where possible to protect individual identities.\n- **Data Sharing Policies**: Clearly outline when and how data can be shared to prevent unauthorized disclosure.\n\n### 6. When to Seek Additional Security Support\n\n- **Increasing Threats**: If facing sophisticated attacks, consult with security experts to enhance defenses.\n- **Compliance Challenges**: Engage specialists if struggling with GDPR compliance or other regulations.\n- **Data Breach Incidents**: Seek professional help immediately in the event of a breach to mitigate damage.\n- **Lack of Expertise**: If internal resources are insufficient, consider external support for robust security measures.\n\n---\n\nThis structured approach ensures that your organization is well-equipped to handle the demands of GDPR, protect sensitive data, and maintain a high level of security protocols. Regular audits and ongoing employee education will further reinforce these practices, ensuring continuous compliance and data integrity."
