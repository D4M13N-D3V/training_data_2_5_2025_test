New Buyers Guides give a framework and provide a checklist to get it right. Over the last few years, the way businesses use technology has undergone a complete transformation, driven by two major trends  mobility and cloud application adoption. At the same time, we are seeing constant evolution of internet threats, which when combined with mobility and cloud, is putting huge pressure on traditional security infrastructure. Cyber threats are becoming more frequent, sophisticated and evasive. The majority start with a malicious email, resulting in email security being one of the main focus areas for cyber security spend, second only to firewalls. Figure 1 Framework for selecting email and web security solutions covered in new Buyers Guide Office 365 Migration Creates Special Issues Everyone who works in IT already understands this of course, but why suggest that Office 365 has any bearing on the email security buying process? There are two parts to the answer. The first is that, through no fault of Microsofts, Office 365 is a victim of its own success. In much the same way that the popularity of Windows resulted in it being targeted by cyber criminals, as the number of Office 365 users increases rapidly, so do the threats specifically targeting those users. Cyren Security Lab research into phishing kits available on the dark web found that kits that phish for Office 365 credentials comprised 25 of the total number being sold. As a consequence, IT and information security professionals with Office 365 deployed are increasingly finding themselves challenged to ensure their email security controls protect their users, company, business partners and customers. The second part of the answer is related to this challenge. The choices available to those evaluating email security products and services today are many and confusing. For companies that have migrated to Office 365, the inclusion of some bundled, basic email security exacerbates the complexity of this process. Buyers Guides Now Available to Navigate Complexity Large enterprises are having their fair share of difficulty in defending against modern internet threats, but they are more likely than not advantaged in terms of planning resources. They have dedicated security teams who assess their security posture and understand the technical, process and people controls that they need to put in place to mitigate the risks to the business. If well-organized, they are able to specify required functionality and work with the messaging infrastructure and operations teams to evaluate products and services. Smaller and mid-sized enterprises will often not pursue the same depth of analysis and planning, as they are likely more budget and resource constrained. Here at Cyren we do believe that the email security buying process has become more difficult, so to help those needing to cut through the complexity we have created a 27-page buyers guide specifically for Office 365 customers, as well as a general buyers guide relevant for those looking for any system, along with other resources also available at those links.

    "content": "### **Security Guidance for Office 365 Users: Best Practices and Data Protection**\n\nAs a security advisor, my goal is to provide clear, practical recommendations to help you protect your data, maintain privacy, and stay safe while using Office 365 and other email services. Below is a comprehensive guide to help you navigate common risks and implement effective security measures.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Easy-to-Follow Security Best Practices**\n\n- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  \n  MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to your phone) in addition to your password. This is one of the most effective ways to prevent unauthorized access to your account.\n\n- **Use Strong, Unique Passwords:**  \n  Avoid using the same password across multiple accounts. Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.\n\n- **Keep Software Updated:**  \n  Regularly update your operating system, browser, and Office 365 applications to ensure you have the latest security patches.\n\n- **Back Up Your Data Regularly:**  \n  While Office 365 includes some backup features, it\u2019s a good idea to use a third-party backup solution to ensure your data is safe in case of accidental deletion or ransomware attacks.\n\n- **Monitor Your Account Activity:**  \n  Check your Office 365 account's recent activity and report any suspicious login attempts or unusual behavior to your IT team.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Data Protection Recommendations**\n\n- **Encrypt Sensitive Files:**  \n  Use Office 365\u2019s built-in encryption tools (e.g., Azure Information Protection) to protect sensitive documents and emails.\n\n- **Restrict Access to Sensitive Data:**  \n  Only share files or folders with people who need access. Avoid using broad sharing permissions.\n\n- **Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP):**  \n  Office 365 offers DLP policies to help detect and prevent sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers, Social Security numbers) from being shared unintentionally.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Safe Usage Guidelines**\n\n- **Be Cautious with Email Attachments and Links:**  \n  Never open suspicious attachments or click on links from unfamiliar senders. Verify the sender\u2019s identity before taking any action.\n\n- **Avoid Phishing Attempts:**  \n  Phishing emails often impersonate legitimate organizations. Look out for spelling mistakes, generic greetings, and urgent requests for action.\n\n- **Use Official Channels for Downloads:**  \n  Only download software or tools from trusted sources to avoid malware infections.\n\n- **Avoid Using Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Tasks:**  \n  Public Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured. Avoid accessing Office 365 or handling sensitive data when connected to public Wi-Fi.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Common Security Risks and Prevention**\n\n- **Phishing Attacks:**  \n  Cybercriminals often target Office 365 users with phishing emails to steal credentials. Train yourself and your team to recognize phishing attempts.  \n  **Prevention:** Use anti-phishing tools, enable MFA, and educate users.\n\n- **Ransomware:**  \n  Ransomware attacks can encrypt your files and demand payment for their release.  \n  **Prevention:** Regularly back up your data, keep software updated, and avoid opening suspicious attachments.\n\n- **Insider Threats:**  \n  Employees with access to sensitive data may intentionally or unintentionally cause harm.  \n  **Prevention:** Monitor user activity, enforce least-privilege access, and implement DLP policies.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Privacy Protection Measures**\n\n- **Limit Data Exposure:**  \n  Avoid oversharing personal or company data in emails or documents. Only share information that is necessary.\n\n- **Use Privacy Settings:**  \n  Adjust your Office 365 privacy settings to control how your data is used and shared.\n\n- **Anonymize Data When Possible:**  \n  When sharing data internally or externally, consider anonymizing sensitive information to protect individual identities.\n\n- **Educate Yourself and Others:**  \n  Stay informed about data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and ensure your team understands the importance of protecting personal data.\n\n---\n\n### **6. When to Seek Additional Security Support**\n\n- **If You Notice Suspicious Activity:**  \n  Report any unauthorized access, unusual login attempts, or potential breaches to your IT department immediately.\n\n- **If You Need Advanced Security Tools:**  \n  Office 365 includes basic security features, but if your organization requires stronger protection, consider investing in third-party email security solutions.\n\n- **For Large-Scale Deployments:**  \n  If your organization is migrating to Office 365 or managing a complex environment, consult with cybersecurity experts to ensure your setup is secure.\n\n- **During a Security Incident:**  \n  If you fall victim to a cyberattack, contact a professional incident response team to minimize damage and restore systems.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nBy following these practical guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of cyber threats and protect your data in Office 365. Stay vigilant, keep your systems updated, and seek professional help when needed. Remember, security is an ongoing effort, and staying informed is your best defense against evolving threats.",
